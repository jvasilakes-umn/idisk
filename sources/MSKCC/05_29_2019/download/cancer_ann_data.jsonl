It is formed by hydroxylation of the amino acid L-tryptophan. 5-HTP is marketed as a dietary supplement for sleep, to improve mood and well-being, and to suppress appetite. Seeds from the African shrub Griffonia simplicifolia are a major source for these supplements due to their high 5-HTP content (1) (2).\nIn animal models, anxiolytic and antidyskinetic effects have been demonstrated (3) (4). 5-HTP has also been shown to restore serotonin levels or, at excessive levels, to induce serotonin syndrome (5) (6).\nIn humans, much of the research on 5-HTP involves small trials with mixed results. A few studies suggest 5-HTP may reduce anxiety (7) (8). Other trials found benefits for depression (2) (9) (10), but not treatment-resistant depression (11) (12). Yet, results from more recent studies suggest antidepressant effects comparable with fluoxetine (13), and potential benefit as part of augmentation therapy for drug-resistant depression (14).\n5-HTP has also been evaluated for obesity. Preliminary findings suggest it may help decrease food intake and increase weight loss and early satiety (15) (16). More recently, a sublingual 5-HTP spray increased appetite control in overweight women (17) (18).\nOther preliminary studies suggest benefit for patients with fibromyalgia (19), but not for postmenopausal hot flashes (20) or tardive dyskinesia (21). 5-HTP does not appear to reduce chronic tension headaches, although a decrease in analgesic use was noted (22). It was also ineffective as prophylaxis for childhood migraine (23), but may improve pediatric sleep terrors (24).\nLarger well-designed studies are needed to determine the populations and conditions for which 5-HTP supplementation may be useful, and to determine safety particularly in conjunction with other serotonergic medications including antidepressants.", "food_sources": "Dietary sources of L-tryptophan, which the body converts to 5-HTP, include turkey, chicken, pumpkin seeds, spinach, milk, and bananas.", "mechanism_of_action": "5-HTP crosses the blood-brain barrier and increases serotonin synthesis (25). The advantage of 5-HTP over L-tryptophan is its ability to bypass the rate-limiting step that tryptophan must undergo via the enzyme tryptophan hydroxylase to convert to 5-HTP. In addition, this enzyme can be inhibited by various factors including B6 or magnesium deficiencies, stress, or insulin resistance, and make tryptophan unavailable for serotonin production (2).\nRelaxation and anxiolytic properties are attributed to the ability of 5-HTP to elevate CNS serotonin levels (2). 5-HTP was shown to augment neuroendocrine response to an SSRI via increased presynaptic 5HT availability, thus enhancing 5HT release into the synapse (26). It was also proposed to potentially reduce hot flashes in menopausal women with breast cancer or with risk of breast cancer by enhancing serotonin levels (27) , but a clinical study in postmenopausal women found it ineffective (20) .\n5-HTP can also increase levels of melatonin, dopamine, and norepinephrine (28) (29), compounds involved in mood and sleep regulation and whose mechanistic pathways may also be stimulated (2). As abnormalities in serotonin and epinephrine pathways have been suspected in fibromyalgia and other chronic diseases (5) (30), this may help to explain preliminary benefits seen with 5-HTP supplementation in other disease states.\nAdditional studies are needed to further identify the mechanisms and conditions under which 5-HTP may exert positive effects or pose concerns when used, especially with other medications due to its modulatory effects on neurotransmitters."}

The stimulus produced by linoleic acid on beta-DNA polymerase, an enzyme involved in repair mechanism following exposure of DNA to alkylating agents, is thought responsible for such an effect (19).\nErgosterol, a major constituent of agaricus, was found to inhibit tumor growth in mice via direct inhibition of tumor-induced angiogenesis (6). Other studies demonstrated that polysaccharides present in agaricus extract caused activation of macrophages (5) or natural killer cells (17) and induced cytotoxic T-lymphocyte activity in tumor-bearing mice. Specifically, activation of natural killer cells was mediated through IL-12-induced IFN-gamma expression (18). Agaricus extract stimulates caspase 3 activation and reduces telomerase activity (19) possibly through regulation of Akt signaling (20) thereby inducing apoptosis in cancer cell lines. Blazeispirol A, produced by agaricus fermentation, causes both caspase-dependent and -independent cell death in human Hep 3B cells (21). Agaritine, a hydrazine-containing constituent also exhibits antitumor activity toward U937 leukemic cells mediated through apoptosis (22).

Amygdalin was first used to treat cancer more than a century ago in Russia and later in the United States. A purified form sold as Laetrile has been a popular alternative cancer therapy since the 1960s. Some claimed amygdalin to be a vitamin (B17) and that deficiencies could cause cancer, but this is not substantiated by scientific evidence (2). Amygdalin is banned in the United States but it is available in other countries and online.\nAmygdalin is metabolized by the enzyme beta-glucosidase into benzaldehyde, glucose and cyanide in the intestine (3) (4). Cyanide is believed to be cytotoxic with actions selective against cancerous cells, but results from animal studies were mostly negative (4) (5) (6). Other preclinical data suggest that amygdalin has hepatoprotective effects (39); may help relieve pain due to its anti-inflammatory (7) and analgesic properties (8); and exerts protective effects by modulating epithelial-mesenchymal transitions following chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (35). Amygdalin also inhibited tumor growth, but further studies are needed to confirm this finding (9).\nA clinical trial in the late 1970s supported by the National Cancer Institute did not find amygdalin beneficial, and some patients in the study developed cyanide toxicity (10). A systematic review also concluded that amygdalin is ineffective against cancer (11). With the recent discovery of anticancer properties of amygdalin through previously unknown mechanisms (12) (13) (14) (15) (16) (32) (36) (37), there is renewed interest in whether this agent may have potential as an anticancer treatment.\nHowever, amygdalin is not approved for use in the United States.", "food_sources": " ", "mechanism_of_action": "Amygdalin is metabolized by the enzyme beta-glucosidase, which removes the glucose molecules to form prunasin and mandelonitrile. This is further broken down to benzaldehyde and hydrocyanic acid (3) (4). When consumed orally, amygdalin is more likely to produce cyanide toxicity, compared with the injectable form (17), possibly due to the presence of enzymes from the microflora in the intestine (18). Cyanide from the hydrolysis of amygdalin is cytotoxic. It was postulated that this action is selective against cancerous cells because normal cells convert the cyanide to benign thiocyanate via rhodanese (19) (20) (21). This theory has not been proven in humans (22).\nAmygdalin demonstrated anti-inflammatory effects by promoting the immunomodulating function of Treg cells (24). In animal studies, amygdalin suppressed prostaglandin E(2) synthesis and nitric oxide production through COX-2 and iNOS inhibition (7). It also reduced inflammation pain by inhibiting tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and interleukin-1 beta (IL-1beta) (8), and exerts neurotrophic effects by activating the extracellular-signal-regulated kinase (ERK) 1/2 pathway (25).\nRecent studies found amygdalin may have anticancer effects. In animal models, amygdalin inhibits the tumor-promoting effect of the Epstein-Barr virus (12). In human prostate cancer DU145 and LNCaP cells, it increased pro-apoptotic Bax protein expression and caspase-3 enzyme activity, while decreasing anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 protein expression (23). It also down regulates cell cycle-related genes in SNU-C4 human colon cancer cells (13). Amygdalin may inhibit growth and proliferation in bladder cancer cell lines by decreasing cell cycle regulatory proteins cdk2 and cyclin A (16).

It is also used as a general tonic, to improve energy levels, health, and longevity (2), and topically as an analgesic (3). Active constituents include alkaloids, steroidal lactones, saponins, and withanolides.\nIn vitro studies suggest that ashwagandha has neuroprotective (26) (37) and anti-inflammatory properties which may protect against cartilage damage in osteoarthritis (4). In addition, improvements in hyperglycemia, hyperinsulinemia, and insulin sensitivity have been detected in an animal model of type 2 diabetes (5). Other studies indicate cytotoxic, chemopreventative, immunomodulating (8), and radiosensitizing effects (1) (9) (10), and enhancement in chromosomal stability (11). Ashwagandha is also rich in iron (2).\nSmall-scale human studies suggest that it may promote growth in children and improve hemoglobin level and red blood cell count (2). In adults, it may improve sexual performance (2) and male infertility (27). An herbal tea containing ashwagandha was shown to increase natural killer cell activity in healthy volunteers with recurrent coughs and colds (22).\nData also indicate that ashwagandha may be helpful for anxiety (23). In patients with schizophrenia, adjunctive treatment with ashwagandha significantly improved symptoms and stress (43), and affected markers of metabolic syndrome (34). Ashwagandha also improved cognitive function in patients with bipolar disorder (35), and is currently being evaluated to assess its effects on nonrestorative sleep (44).\nPreliminary data suggest that ashwagandha may help to improve balance in patients with progressive degenerative cerebral ataxias (24). An herbo-mineral formula containing ashwagandha was shown to benefit osteoarthritis (13). In a double-blind RCT, a standardized extract produced analgesic, anti-inflammatory, and chondroprotective effects in patients with knee joint pain (41).\nIn laboratory studies, ashwagandha reduced growth of breast, central nervous system, colon, and lung cancer cells (6) without affecting normal cells (7), but was not effective against drug-resistant cancer stem cells (36). The compound Withaferin A enhanced oxaliplatin effects in human pancreatic cancer cells (38). Ashwagandha was also shown to prevent chemotherapy-induced neutropenia in mice (12).\nIn a small study of breast cancer patients, ashwagandha alleviated chemotherapy-induced fatigue and improved quality of life (31). Larger trials are needed to confirm these observations.", "food_sources": " ", "mechanism_of_action": "Alkaloids, steroidal lactones, saponins, and withanolides are considered the biologically active components of ashwagandha. Anti-arthritic effects are attributed to cyclooxygenase (COX) inhibition.\nIn animal studies, anti-inflammatory activity by ashwagandha was comparable to hydrocortisone (15). Brain antioxidant effects and CNS tranquilizing effects may be due to influences on GABA receptor function (2) (17). Withanolides in the roots and leaves are considered similar to steroids in their biological activities (41). Triethylene glycol, a compound isolated from the leaves, was identified as an active sleep-inducing component in a murine model, and may potentially be used to relieve insomnia (42).\nMicroarray analysis revealed that ashwagandha represses proinflammatory gene expression, including IL-6, IL-1\u03b2, IL-8, Hsp70, and STAT-2, and induces p38/MAPK expression in a prostate cancer cell line (16). Ashwagandha may inhibit tumor growth (1) (21) and increased cytotoxic T lymphocyte production (8). In vitro studies show that root extracts have cytotoxic properties against lung, colon, CNS, and breast cancer cell lines (6). Withaferin A induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and disruption of mitochondrial function in a human leukemia cell line, thereby inducing apoptosis (18). In estrogen receptor-positive (ER+) and negative (ER-) breast cancer cells, withaferin A induced apoptosis and decreased tumor size (19). Apoptosis of cancer cells by withanone is mediated through p53 (7). Withianone also exerts anticancer activity by binding to the TPX2-Aurora A Complex (29). Other studies show ashwagandha cytotoxicity is related to its structure. It enhances ATPase and inhibits succinate dehydrogenase activities, impairing oxidative phosphorylation.\nIn animal studies, ashwagandha enhanced radiation therapy effects (20) by reducing tumor GSH levels (10), and reversed paclitaxel-induced neutropenia in mice (12).\nNo significant interactions have been reported between ashwagandha and either CYP3A4 or CYP2D6 enzymes in human liver microsomes (40)."}

The root of A. membranaceus has a long history of use in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), and is often used along with other herbs as a tonic to increase stamina, strength, and vitality. Extracts of astragalus are sold as dietary supplements to improve immune function and to decrease fatigue. Polysaccharides and triterpenoid saponin compounds isolated from astragalus have been used in scientific research.\nAstragalus and its constituents have antioxidant (27), anti-inflammatory (28), and antiviral (29) activities. In vitro and animal studies suggest protective effects on the heart (30) (31) (32), kidney (33) (34) (35), bones (36) , and the nervous system (11) (17) (37).\nClinical studies of astragalus in humans showed promising results. A case report suggests it may reduce proteinuria associated with idiopathic membranous nephropathy (7). In small studies of healthy individuals, astragalus exhibited sodium-excreting properties (8) and produced a viral-type immune response (38). A formula containing astragalus as a major ingredient reduced fatigue in athletes (10). When used as an injection, astragalus appeared to benefit patients with IgA nephropathy (26). Astragalus used in Chinese medicine helped reduce diabetic ketoacidosis (39). In a small study of dialysis patients, an astragalus-based TCM formula significantly preserved residual renal function (40).\nAnticancer properties have been observed in vitro with some compounds from astragalus against gastric (41), colon (42) (43) (44) (45), hepatic (46) and ovarian (59) cancers. Astragalus has also been associated with prolonged survival times in acute myeloid leukemia patients (47).\nData also suggest beneficial effects when used with chemotherapy (1) (2). In vitro, concomitant treatment with aldesleukin and astragalus potentiated tumoricidal activity while decreasing side effects (14). It also enhanced platinum-based chemotherapy (3) and protected against oxaliplatin neurotoxicity (48). Astragalus saponins reversed toxicities of fluorouracil (42) (28) and augmented the therapeutic benefit of vinblastine while reducing neutropenic and anemic effects in vivo (44). An injectable form of astragalus with vinorelbine and cisplatin improved quality of life in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (20), but whether orally administered astragalus would exert the same effects is unknown. In another study, an astragalus extract helped to manage cancer-related fatigue (22). Meta-analyses identified astragalus as among the traditional medicines associated with reductions in chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (49), and to have benefits in patients with hepatocellular cancers (16), but larger well-designed trials to confirm these findings are needed.\nAlthough astragalus is generally safe, it may interact with certain drugs. Because this botanical and its constituents have demonstrated antioxidant (27) and estrogenic (23) (50) activities, it may interfere with some chemotherapy drugs and/or affect hormone-sensitive cancers. However, these findings are from in vitro and animal studies, and cannot be extrapolated to clinical recommendations. The physiological concentration used in these studies is unlikely to be achieved in humans, which makes it difficult to predict the downstream effects/interactions.\nClinical studies are needed to determine the circumstances under which astragalus could be useful as an adjuvant therapy to standard cancer treatments.", "food_sources": " ", "mechanism_of_action": "Polysaccharides, triterpenoid saponins, and flavonoids are the main constituents of astragalus with immunomodulating, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anticancer effects (27) (51). In vitro studies suggest the saponin astragaloside I promotes osteoblastic differentiation by regulating the Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway (36). Cardioprotective effects from astragaloside IV may occur via the notch1/hes1 signaling pathway (30). In addition, it augments fibrinolytic potential via increases in tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA) synthesis and downregulation of PA inhibitor type 1 (PAI-1) (21). Other anticoagulant activities are attributed to upregulation of KLF2 mRNA expression and inhibition of NF-kB signaling pathway (52).\nPolysaccharides isolated from astragalus produce immunomodulating effects via activation of toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4)-related mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) activities (53). In murine models, they reduced colitis via inhibition of NOD-like receptor protein 3 inflammasome, which decreases inflammatory factors such as interleukin (IL)-18 and IL-1beta (54), and reduced multiorgan iron overload via upregulated hepcidin and IL-6 expression and enhanced p38 MAPK phosphorylation (55). Cardioprotective effects with this constituent were attributed to anti-inflammatory properties and improved balance between reactive oxygen species (ROS) and NO (32).\nIn a diabetic rat model, astragalus polysaccharides exerted effects on glucose and lipid metabolism and insulin resistance (37).\nBenefits to counteract memory disorders were seen with astragalus due to its activity as a nerve-growth promoting factor (17) and by its ability to increase M-cholinergic receptor density in senile rats (11).\nIn dialysis patients, an astragalus-based TCM formula enhanced NO production and transforming growth factor beta suppression (40). In IgA nephropathy patients, an astragalus injection decreased Core I \u03b23-Gal-T-specific molecular chaperone (Cosmc) gene expression and increased IgA1 O-glycosylation levels (26). In healthy individuals, a sublingual/ingested astragalus root extract produced increases in monocytes, neutrophils, lymphocytes, and platelets, as well as circulating cytokines levels, and self-reported symptoms similar to viral type immune responses such as fatigue, malaise, and headache (38). In another study, a formula containing astragalus reduced fatigue in athletes by increasing the uptake and utility of oxygen (10).\nMechanisms by which astragalus and its constituents may exert anticancer effects have also been examined. In human colorectal cancers cell lines, astragalus suppressed chromosome organization, histone modification, and regulation of macromolecule metabolism, as well as several cancer signaling pathways (56). Saponins induced S phase and G2/M arrest and suppressed p21 expression and cyclin-dependent kinase activity (42). Modulation of mTOR signaling and COX2 downregulation also occurred, which in turn can reduce VEGF levels to suppress angiogenesis (43). In gastric adenocarcinoma cells, caspase 3 activation, G2/M phase cell cycle arrest, cyclin B1, p21 and c-myc regulation, and downregulation of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and metalloproteinase (MMP)-2 and MMP-9 occurred (41). Combined with vinblastine, saponins boosted downregulation of proangiogenic and proliferative factors while attenuating neutropenia and anemia seen with this chemotherapy (44). In combination with calpain inhibitors, these saponins may also exert more pronounced apoptotic effects (45). Polysaccharides potentiate immune-mediated antitumor activity of interleukin-2 in vitro (13), improve lymphocyte responses, enhance natural killer cell activity, potentiate monocyte activity (14), and increase phagocytosis perhaps by regulating tumor necrosis factor production (5). Apoptotic effects by polysaccharides in hepatocellular carcimona cells were attributed to decreased Notch1 expression (46).\nFormononetin derived from astragalus was shown to have estrogen-receptor-modulating effects (50). Angiogenic effects of astragaloside IV appear to be synergized when combined with ferulic acid from Angelica sinsensis (57)."}

It is available in a few clinics in North America, but there is no licensure for practicing Ayurveda in the United States. Ayurvedic medicinals, which can contain from a few to hundreds of components, are commonly used to treat chronic diseases such as diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, Parkinson\u2019s disease, acne, obesity, and cancer.\nClinical trials show benefit of various formulations in treating fibromyalgia (1), diabetes (2), hyperlipidemia (3) (4), hypothyroidism (39), anemia (5), dyspepsia (6), acute viral hepatitis (11), acne vulgaris (12) (45), obesity (13), and rheumatoid arthritis (14) (15) (40).

Patients are classified by their prominent dosha, or physical, emotional, and metabolic type, Kapha, Pitta, or Vata, each located in specific organs and associated with two of the five elements (earth, fire, water, air, and ether) and five senses. The doshas represent properties shared by the organs, body, environment and cosmos. When a patient\u2019s unique state of dosha is out of balance, illness occurs. Therapy is personalized to the individual\u2019s problems and metabolic characteristics to restore balance through diet and lifestyle modifications, medicinals (herbs, spices, metals and/or animal products), breathing exercises, and meditation. Detoxification (panchakarma) occurs before administration of medicines, which includes bloodletting, induced vomiting, and bowel purging. The therapeutic approach seeks to cure disease by reversing the steps that led to it (e.g., administering cooling medicines if Pitta, the hot dosha, is predominant) (10).\nMaharasnadi Quathar, a medicinal used to treat rheumatoid arthritis, increases antioxidant enzyme activity, decreases TBARS generation, and improves symptoms in human subjects (16). Many of the frequently used herbs, such as ashwagandha (Withania somnifera), guggul (Commiphora mukul), Boswellia (Boswellia serrata), gotu kola (Centella asiatica), curcumin (Curcuma longa), ginger (Zingiber officinale), aloe (Aloe barbadensis), and garlic (Allium sativum), have been studied extensively in vitro and in vivo, and show antioxidant, antitumor, antimicrobial, immunomodulatory, or anti-inflammatory properties. Herbs often used to treat diabetes, Gymnema sylvestre, Momordica charantia, fenugreek (Trigonella foenum-graecum) Coccinia indica, and Pterocarpus marsupium, show hypoglycemic activity in vitro and in vivo. Mucuna pruriens, used in preparations for Parkinson\u2019s disease, contains L-dopa (17). Rasayana herbs (said to promote positive health) such as ashwagandha, Asparagus racemosus, Emblica officinalis, Piper longum, and Terminalia chebula showed immunostimulant and adaptogenic activities in an animal study (18). Ayurvedic gold preparations (e.g., Swarna Bhasma) have antioxidant and restorative effects in animal models of ischemia (19). The herbal mixtures Maharishi Amrit Kalash-4 and -5 have antioxidant properties, inhibit LDL oxidation in vitro, inhibit platelet aggregation, and cause a reduction in aortic arch atheroma in hyperlipidemic rabbits (20).\nAn in vitro study investigated the activity of extracts from eight plants that are traditionaly used as immunomodulators in Ayurvedic medicine against HIV: Allium sativum, Asparagus racemosus, Coleus forskohlii, Emblica officinalis, Glycyrrhiza glabra, Piper longum, Tinospora cordifolia and Withania somnifera (21).

Beta-carotene, along with alpha-carotene and beta-cryptoxanthin, can be converted to retinol and is classified as a provitamin A carotenoid. Supplementation with beta-carotene does not increase overall vitamin A levels or lead to vitamin A toxicity. Animal studies show that beta-carotene promotes the development of pulmonary adenocarcinoma via increased cAMP signaling (29).\nAvailable data of beta-carotene supplementation for HIV-positive patients and its effects on CD4 counts (10) as well as cardiovascular disease are conflicting. A meta-analysis demonstrated a small but significant increase in all-cause mortality and cardiovascular death for the beta-carotene arm over placebo (11), whereas other studies reported no such effects (39) or benefits of beta-carotene supplementation on cardiovascular disease (12) or its risk factors (13). Consistent associations between serum beta-carotene levels and risk of developing type 2 diabetes are lacking as well (14) (15). Additional studies have reported serum beta-carotene to be inversely associated with the incidence of cataract formation (16); higher intake of \u03b2-carotene (while avoiding vitamin C supplements) to be associated with lowered risk of acquired hearing loss in women (40); long-term supplementation to increase cognitive function (17); and high dietary intake to have a protective effect on buccal cells from relative telomere length (RTL) shortening (41).\n\nEpidemiological associations between beta-carotene and cancer risk are conflicting. Whereas high dietary intake was associated with reduced risk of cervical cancer (1), high serum levels were associated with increased risk for aggressive prostate cancer (2), but with reduced risk of aggressive urothelial cell carcinoma (32). Findings of beta-carotene and chemoprevention are inconsistent as well. Consumption of beta carotene, vitamins A, C, fruits and vegetables did not influence the risk of renal cell carcinoma (31); supplementation with antioxidants, beta-carotene and vitamins A, C, and E, did not prevent gastrointestinal cancer, and beta-carotene may actually increase overall mortality (3) (4). Data from large, multi-center trials suggest that supplementation may not lower the risk of prostate cancer (5) (6), and in male smokers over the age 40, it may increase lung cancer incidence (7) (30) (42).  When combined with cigarette smoking, beta-carotene supplements may also reduce the efficacy of cancer therapies, resulting in increased recurrence and mortality (8). A large-scale cohort study in the Netherlands suggests that alcohol consumption, too, has a negative effect on the chemopreventive property of beta-carotene (9).\nThe U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommends against beta-carotene or vitamin E supplements for the prevention of cardiovascular disease or cancer (33).", "food_sources": "Deep yellow and orange fruits (apricots, cantaloupe, papaya), squash, carrots, sweet potatoes, pumpkin, leafy greens, and broccoli (18) (19)", "mechanism_of_action": "Beta-carotene has strong antioxidant effects.

It was also shown to alleviate the severity of ulcerative colitis in a murine model by modulating several molecular targets including nuclear factor-kappa B, cyclooxygenase-2, interleukin 17, and connective tissue growth factor (35).\nIn other studies, beta-carotene reduced cell growth and induced apoptosis in a variety of cancer cell lines through caveolin-1 expression (20). In vivo studies suggest that it induces glutathione production (21). Beta-carotene may also enhance macrophage function and natural killer (NK) cell cytotoxicity, and increase T-helper lymphocyte counts. However, clinical findings suggest that beta-carotene can increase cancer risk.

Beta-elemene also exhibits anti-inflammatory effects, with reduction in LPS-induced nitric oxide production and prostaglandin E2 by rat peritoneal macrophages (11).\n\nBeta-elemene has been shown to affect cancer cells via different mechanisms. In an in vitro study, following administration of beta-elemene, leukemia cells were arrested in S/G2 phase and underwent apoptosis (2). The antiproliferative effects were dependent on p38 MAPK activation/phosphorylation, cell cycle arrest in G0/G1, and inhibition of tumor growth of glioblastoma cells (3). Beta-elemene also induced G2/M arrest in lung carcinoma cells and ovarian cancer cells by combined reduction of cell-cycle promoters Cdc2 and cyclin B1, and elevated cell cycle regulators p53 and p27 (4) (5). Derivatives of beta-elemene showed antiproliferative activity in human cervical carcinoma cells through a decrease in cell cycle protein Cyclin D1 and thus cell cycle suppression (14). Furthermore, beta-elemene may enhance the effects of chemotherapy and radiation. In non-small cell lung cancer cells, apoptosis was induced by increased expression of Bax and p-Bcl-2, decreased Bcl-2 and XIAP, and augmented cisplatin-induced increases in caspase activity (6). In another study, apoptosis response to the taxanes paclitaxel and docetaxel in lung carcinoma cells was enhanced with beta-elemene, through increases in cytochrome c, caspase activity, downregulation of Bcl-2, and altered cell membrane permeability (7). Beta-elemene combined with radiation induced apoptosis in lung adenocarcinoma cells, possibly by sensitizing cancer cells to radiation (8).\n\nAn in vivo study showed that beta-elemene inhibits growth of lung cancer cells, and up-regulates the expression of the tumor suppressor, P53, and the release of exosome (22). Another proposed mechanism is that beta-elemene reverses the resistance of lung cancer cells to cisplatin via the mitochondrial apoptosis pathway (23)."}

Human studies are mixed on whether bilberry anthocyanosides improve visual acuity, night vision, or retinal function (5) (6) ; many of the positive studies are poorly designed (7). A small trial suggests bilberry may improve visual function in some individuals with normal tension glaucoma (8), but generally human data on bilberry for eye disorders are lacking (9).\nIn other studies, a standardized bilberry extract was shown to reduce disease activity in patients with mild to moderate ulcerative colitis (10).

Studies also indicate that bitter melon extracts have the potential for increasing insulin sensitivity in patients with type-2 diabetes compared to those with type-1 disease (31). And supplementation was found useful in reducing pain and improving symptoms in primary knee osteoarthritis patients (41).\nIn a study of cervical cancer patients, bitter melon had no effect on natural killer cell activity (10).\nAlthough bitter melon is consumed as food, ingesting the seeds, extracts, and large quantities of juice can cause adverse effects.", "food_sources": " ", "mechanism_of_action": "In an animal model, bitter melon extract showed hypoglycemic activity by suppressing glucose-6-phosphatase and fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase enzymes in the liver (14). It improved insulin sensitivity, glucose tolerance and insulin signaling (15); it also reduced insulin resistance by influencing peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) alpha and PPAR gamma expression (16) and by modulating the phosphorylation status of insulin receptor and its downstream signaling molecules (17). The preventive effects of bitter melon against insulin resistance are thought to be via modulation of nuclear factor (NF-kappa B) and phospho-c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) pathways (36).\n\nBitter melon may help weight loss by reducing lipogenesis in adipose tissue. Animals that were fed with bitter melon showed lower fatty acid synthase (18). Bitter melon also affects fat and carbohydrate metabolism by stimulating thyroid hormones and adiponectin, and by enhancing the activity of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) (19). In another study, it was shown to prevent inflammation and oxidative stress, modulate mitochondrial activity, suppress apoptosis activation, and inhibit lipid accumulation during the development of fatty liver (32).  \nBitter melon displays cytotoxic activity: A ribosome inhibiting protein (RIP) MCP30 has been shown to inhibit histone deacetylase-1 (HDAC-1) activity and induce apoptosis in prostate cancer cells (1). In another study, a triterpene extracted from bitter melon activated peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) gamma and induced apoptosis in breast cancer cells (20). Bitter melon juice also caused apoptosis by inducing caspase-3 activation through adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) in pancreatic cell lines (3). Similar effects were observed with methanol extracts which increase Bax and decrease the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 (21) (22). Other studies demonstrated reduction in metastasis via suppression of MMP-2 and MMP-9 enzymatic activities in lung adenocarcinoma CL1 cells (23). Bitter melon juice was found effective in decreasing phosphorylation of the protein kinases Akt and ERK1/2, and viability of gemcitabine-resistant pancreatic cancer cells (37). MAP30, a ribosome inhibiting protein (RIP) isolated from bitter melon seeds, inhibited HIV-1 integrase and inactive DNA topology (24), leading to poor viral DNA integration (25) ."}

Borage oil products should be certified free of UPAs (meeting the criterion of no more than 0.5-1 ug/g)  (2).", "clinical_summary": "Borage oil, derived from the seeds of the plant, is a rich source of gamma-linolenic acid (GLA) and linoleic acid (LA). In herbal and traditional medicine, borage oil has been used to induce sweating, as an expectorant and anti-inflammatory, to promote lactation, to stimulate adrenal function, and as an alternative source to evening primrose oil for obtaining GLA (13). It has also been promoted to treat rheumatoid arthritis, atopic dermatitis, diabetic neuropathy, menopause-related symptoms, and gastrointestinal disease (14) (15).\nIn vitro and in vivo studies suggest antimutagenic and cytotoxic effects (16). In an animal model of senile osteoporosis, a diet rich in borage or fish oils restored inflammation and bone parameters (17). Borage extract consumption improved markers of disease-induced cognitive dysfunction in Alzheimer\u2019s models (18).\nIn humans, studies show that GLA from borage seed oil has some benefits in treating rheumatoid arthritis (RA) (7) (9). A long-term study evaluating fish and borage seed oils in RA patients at increased risk for cardiovascular disease suggest these may be useful to correct dyslipidemia when used either alone or in combination (19). Other analyses suggest moderate evidence of GLA-containing oils including borage oil for the relief of RA symptoms such as pain intensity and disability without increased adverse events, but adequate dose and treatment duration are unknown (20), and there was not enough available evidence to support their current use in RA management (21).\nStudies are mixed on the effect of borage oil for skin conditions such as atopic eczema (11) (12) and infantile seborrheic dermatitis (5). Several analyses indicate that neither evening primrose oil nor borage oil are effective in treating atopic eczema, with improvements being similar to respective placebos (22) (23). A combination of seed oils from borage and echium (a plant rich in linolenic acid) produced anti-inflammatory effects in patients with mild asthma (24). In patients with early-stage type 2 diabetes or metabolic syndrome, this combined supplementation also significantly lowered total and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels (25).\nBorage oil contains pyrrolizidine alkaloids that are hepatotoxic (26). Risk of hepatic damage increases with length of exposure and cumulative dose consumed. Patients should use borage oil certified free of unsaturated pyrrolizidine alkaloids. Borage oil may be unsafe during pregnancy (27).", "food_sources": " ", "mechanism_of_action": "The anti-inflammatory properties of borage oil have been attributed to its high GLA content (16). It also contains other fatty acids including linoleic, oleic, palmitic, stearic, eicosenoic, and erucic acids (28). GLA can be converted to the prostaglandin precursor dihomo-gama-linolenic acid (DGLA). DGLA can block the transformation of arachidonic acid to leukotrienes and other prostaglandins (10). GLA can increase cAMP levels which suppress the synthesis of tumor necrosis factor-alpha, an inflammatory mediator linked to rheumatoid arthritis (9). The mucilage constituent has an expectorant-like action and malic acid has a mild diuretic effect. The tannin constituent may have mild astringent and constipating actions (3).\nIn vitro, a borage oil formulation demonstrated inhibitory effects on alpha-amylase, an enzyme that hydrolyzes 1,4-alpha-glucoside bonds in oligo- and polysaccharides, which is the first step in digestion of dietary starch and glycogen (29). In animal models, borage oil improved amyloid-beta-induced long-term potentiation disruption in the hippocampal dentate gyrus, providing a neuroprotective effect attributed to the scavenging of free radicals (18). Borage-enriched sunflower oil counteracted pro-inflammatory mechanisms and prevented senile osteoporosis, by inhibiting osteoblast-induced osteoclast formation (17).\nIn human studies, dietary supplementation with borage and echium seed oils produced anti-inflammatory effects in mild asthmatics by altering polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) levels and by attenuating leukotriene production (24).\nAlthough aerial parts of borage demonstrate affinity for the serotonin transporter, its toxicity profile precludes its further development as an herbal drug (30). Borage contains several minor constituents known as pyrrolizidine alkaloids which are hepatotoxic, including amabiline, supinine, lycopsamine, intermedine, acetyllycopsamine and acetylintermedine (26) (31). Borage oil also has teratogenic effects, and its prostaglandin E agonist action may cause premature labor (9)."}

The gummy exudate or resin obtained by peeling away the bark is commonly known as frankincense or olibanum. Boswellia, also referred to as Indian frankincense, is used widely in Ayurveda for treating arthritis, ulcerative colitis, coughs, sores, wound healing, and asthma. It is marketed as a supplement to support and improve joint health and mobility.\nThe major component is boswellic acid (1), a 5-lipoxygenase inhibitor with anti-inflammatory and anti-arthritic effects (1) (2) (3). It also demonstrated cytotoxic (4) (5) (6) (7) and radio-enhancing properties (21), and prevented intestinal tumorigenesis in a murine model (26). Other animal studies suggest boswellia may improve cognitive impairment and insulin resistance (42). Essential oil of boswellia has been shown to have antimicrobial activities (24).\nData from clinical trials indicate effectiveness of boswellia for bronchial asthma (8), ulcerative colitis (9), mild irritable bowel syndrome (38), and osteo-muscular pain (36). Current evidence is mixed on its benefits for collagenous colitis (12) (13) (14) or osteoarthritis (10) (11). Some studies report efficacy of formulations containing boswellia, Terminalia chebula, turmeric (39), and boswellic acid along with curcumin (40) in managing pain and discomfort associated with osteoarthritis. Larger well-designed studies are needed for clinical recommendation (41). Boswellia has also been investigated for its role in maintenance of Crohn\u2019s disease remission, but demonstrated no significant benefit (15).\n\nBoswellia has also been investigated for its anticancer potential. Preliminary data suggest its effectiveness in reducing cerebral edema in patients with brain tumors following radiotherapy (23). A boswellia-based cream was found useful in preventing skin damage due to radiotherapy in breast cancer patients (32). Other data suggest that a combination of boswellic acid, betaine, and myo-inositol treatment may help to reduce mammary density, a risk factor for breast cancer (33).\nAlthough similar in many functions, boswellia should not be confused with guggul or myrrh.", "food_sources": " ", "mechanism_of_action": "Boswellic acid, the major constituent of boswellia, is thought to contribute to most of the herb\u2019s pharmacological activities. In vitro and animal studies show that anti-inflammatory activity occurs via inhibition of 5-lipoxygenase (2) (3) and cyclooxygenase-1 (35). It also inhibits nuclear transcription factor KappaB (NF-KappaB) signaling, markedly decreasing production of the key proinflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor (TNF-alpha) (17). Unlike other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, however, boswellic acid failed to show analgesic or antipyretic effects (16).\n\nResearch on cytotoxic effects of boswellic acid indicates that it induces p21 expression through a p53-independent pathway and causes apoptosis in glioma (4) (6) and leukemia (5) cell lines. A boswellia extract induced apoptosis in a cervical cancer cell line by inducing endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress (18). Other apoptotic mechanisms include early generation of nitric oxide and reactive oxygen species that upregulated time-dependent expression of p53/p21/PUMA (19), inhibition of microsomal prostaglandin E synthase-1 (mPGES-1), and decreased prostaglandin (PGE2) levels and its downstream targets (37).\n\nA semisynthetic analog of boswellic acid, 3-alpha-Butyryloxy-beta-boswellic acid, demonstrated significant growth inhibition in Ehrlich Ascitic Tumour (EAT), Ehrlich Ascitic Carcinoma (EAC) and Sarcoma-180 tumor models, via NF-KappaB downregulation and induction of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) cleavage (27). Acetyl-boswellic acids inhibited topoisomerases by competing with DNA for binding sites (20). Acetyl-11-keto-beta-boswellic acid (AKBA) inhibited human prostate tumor growth via inhibition of VEGFR2-induced angiogenesis (22).

Small studies also suggest it may be useful for treating skin conditions such as pityriasis lichenoides chronica (PLC) (2); for reducing mild, acute knee pain (3); and for alleviating post-operative pain and swelling (27) (29) (30). But data on bromelain\u2019s pain relieving effects in arthritic patients are mixed (4) (5) (6). A randomized study did not find any benefit in reducing fibrinogen or in influencing other risk factors of cardiovascular disease (31).\n\nBromelain has been investigated for its anticancer potential as well. It was shown to have chemopreventive (19) (25) and antitumorigenic effects (20) (26), and increased the survival indices of animals bearing leukemia, sarcoma, lung, breast, and ascetic tumors (10).

Studies show that it prevents platelet aggregation and adhesion of platelets to blood vessel endothelial cells, as well as improving ischemia-reperfusion injury (13). It can act as an anti-inflammatory agent by reducing levels of prostaglandin E2 and thromboxane A2 (9). In addition, bromelain inhibits neutrophil migration in response to IL-8 during inflammation (14) and decreases pro-inflammatory chemokine and cytokine secretion (15) (16). Topical application of bromelain may be used for the skin debridement of burns (1).\n\nOral enzymes such as bromelain have been proposed as additive agents for cancer therapy (8). Proposed mechanisms include down-regulation of the immunosuppressive cytokine, TGF-beta (7), direct inhibition of tumor cell growth, modulation of immune cell function, modulation of cell adhesion molecules (CAMs), and the effects on platelet aggregation and thrombosis mentioned above (8) (9). Experiments with murine models showed that bromelain induced apoptosis-related proteins along with inhibiting NF-kappaB-driven Cox-2 expression by blocking the MAPK and Akt/protein kinase B signaling in DMBA-TPA-induced skin tumors (20). Bromelain also induced the expression of autophagy-related proteins, light chain 3 protein B II (LC3BII), and beclin-1 thereby facilitating apoptosis in mammary carcinoma cells (26)."}

It is often combined with procedures such as coffee enemas in alternative cancer treatment regimens. Budwig believed that cancer was caused by the lack of polyunsaturated fatty acids, and that a combination of flax oil and cottage cheese would improve cellular function.\n\nThe diet consists of a mixture of flax oil and cottage cheese as well as vegetables, fruits, and juices. It prohibits consumption of sugar, animal fats, shellfish, processed foods, soy and most dairy products, and encourages daily sunbathing (1).\n\nAlthough Budwig wrote books and papers to provide anecdotal evidence and biochemical mechanisms of the diet, no clinical trials have been published in any peer-reviewed medical journal. Polyunsaturated fatty acids, like omega-3 found in flaxseeds, have been shown to exert anticancer activities (2), but there is no evidence that such a diet has any benefit in preventing or treating cancer in humans. Whereas a balanced diet consisting of vegetables and fruits can be beneficial for general health, restricted diets may increase risk of nutritional deficiencies (3).

While metabolic changes such as increased aerobic glycolysis and fatty acid synthesis occur in cancerous cells, (8) the role of O3FAs in the pathogenesis and treatment of cancer is still under investigation (2). The polyunsaturated O3FAs in flaxseed oil have been shown to decrease levels of proinflammatory cytokines, tumor necrosis factor (TNF) alpha and Interleukin-1 beta (9). O3FAs also demonstrated antineoplastic properties by increasing intracellular reactive oxygen species and decreasing protumorigenic prostaglandins (2). Flax oil supplements increased total phospholipid fatty acid content in erythrocytes  (10), but the implication of this finding in cancer treatment is unknown. Flaxseed supplements also inhibit proliferation of human prostate cancer (11) and inhibit breast cancer growth in vitro by downregulating growth factors and increasing p53 expression (12). Furthermore, whole flaxseed contains lignans, phytoestrogens which may also have antineoplastic properties and exert hormonal effects (13).\n\nBudwig believed that combining cottage cheese and flaxseed oil allowed for better availability of essential fatty acids through the plasma membrane, allowing for improved aerobic cellular respiration (1). The effect of cottage cheese consumption on the bioavailability of O3FAs has not been studied. Processed fats, saturated fats, animal fats, processed foods, and sugar are prohibited in the Budwig diet because they are thought to interfere with oxygen uptake and cellular respiration. Epidemiological studies show that people who consume lacto-vegetarian diets have lower incidence of gastrointestinal cancer compared with non-vegetarians (14) (15), although these studies indicate association rather than causation.\n\nAn animal study showed that greater tumor regression occurred in mice treated with trastuzumab therapy plus flax oil compared with those treated with trastuzumab alone (16)."}

Increasing calcium via diet rather than supplements may lower the risk (54). For those who must take calcium in supplement form, adequate fluid intake is important to help reduce this risk (55)."], "clinical_summary": "Calcium is an essential mineral responsible for many physiological functions in the body. It is stored in the bones and helps maintain bone structure. Calcium also plays an important role in cell signaling and muscle contraction. Dietary calcium can be found in dairy products, dark greens, legumes, nuts and fish. Natural supplements are derived from minerals, oyster shells and occasionally corals. Calcium can be found in some antacids as well.\nThe effects of calcium have been studied across a range of conditions including cardiovascular disease (1) (2) (3) (4) (5), osteoporosis (6), bone density loss (7), fracture prevention (8), premenstrual syndrome (9), preeclampsia (10) (11), lead poisoning (12), and various cancers (13) (14) (15).\nLong-term calcium supplement use is associated with an increased risk of coronary artery calcification (77). Some studies suggest that calcium supplementation could lead to cardiovascular disease or events (1) (2) (3) (5), but other researchers have not agreed with these conclusions (16) (17) (18). In a Women\u2019s Health Initiative sub-study, calcium plus vitamin D supplementation and hormone therapy yielded greater reductions in LDL-C than either intervention alone or placebo (81). Calcium and vitamin D supplementation may benefit postmenopausal women who do not have pre-existing risk factors such as coronary heart disease, diabetes, or hypertension (19) and large long-term studies in women did not find adverse cardiovascular associations with calcium supplementation (4) (20). However, high intakes of calcium supplements did increase cardiovascular mortality in men (21). Another study shows calcium supplement intake is associated with dementia in women after stroke (75).\nThere is also conflicting evidence on calcium intake or calcium plus vitamin D supplementation on bone density and fractures (22) (23) (24) (42) (53) (82). Recent US Preventive Services Task Force reports found no associations between calcium plus vitamin D supplementation and reduced falls or fracture incidence for community-dwelling older adults without known deficiencies, osteoporosis, or history of fracture (83) (84). In postmenopausal women, neither dietary calcium (25) nor calcium plus vitamin D supplementation (26) reduced hip fracture risk, although the latter study found significant reductions at 7 years (27). Subgroup analysis further suggested that supplementation along with estrogen therapy conferred additive protection against hip fractures (28). However, there appears to be no prevention benefits with calcium and vitamin D supplementation for bone mineral density loss in breast cancer patients (7) or for older adults to help prevent fractures (78). Calcium plus vitamin D mitigated bone density loss associated with antiretroviral therapy (72). In men, bone mineral density and bone loss rates were not related to dietary calcium intake (79).\nBoth dietary and supplemental calcium are linked with lower risk of colorectal cancer (13) (29), but had no effect on colorectal adenomas (74). For men, calcium intake is associated with increased risk for prostate cancer (30) (31); a genetic disposition for high intestinal absorption of calcium among African-American men has also been noted (32) (33). Long-term studies suggest risks associated with calcium in prostate cancers are less strong when phosphorus intake is also considered (34) (35).\nFor women, studies on calcium plus vitamin D supplementation to reduce various disease risks are conflicting for colorectal cancers (38) (85), all cancer types (36) (86), and mortality (26) (37). Other studies suggest benefits against hematologic (80) but not invasive cancers (39).\nIn general, the evidence is insufficient to assess benefits of calcium plus vitamin D supplementation for those receiving androgen deprivation therapy, aromatase inhibitors, or undergoing chemotherapy-induced menopause (7) (43) (44). Patients should consult with their oncologist or oncology healthcare team, especially since calcium supplements can interact with a number of drugs.\nA proper diet to achieve a balance among nutrients including sodium, potassium, magnesium, calcium and vitamin D is important to affect risks for hypertension as well as cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events (40). The risk\u2013benefit ratio of supplementation is likely to vary, depending on dietary calcium intake, sex, age, ethnicity, and individual risks for cardiovascular disease and osteoporosis (41) (73). Intake of high-dose calcium supplements (>1 g/day) can also increase the risk of ischemic stroke (76). Calcium and vitamin D supplementation may increase the risk for kidney stones (42) (48) (53) (84).", "food_sources": "Milk, yogurt, cheese, egg, bread, salmon, prawns, sardines, shrimp, broccoli, spinach, kale, collards, spring greens, baked beans, chickpeas, lentils, kidney beans, soya beans, tofu, orange, almonds, sesame seeds and fortified cereals, orange juice and soy milk", "mechanism_of_action": "Calcium plays an important role in a variety of muscular, vascular, neurological, hormonal, and enzymatic reactions throughout the body. Calcium reserves are found mostly in the bones, helping to maintain skeletal structure.\nThe association of supplemental but not dietary calcium with increased cardiovascular risk could be related to their differing, acute effects on serum calcium (45). Calcium supplementation may fail to compensate for renal calcium loss, resulting in increased circulatory calcium that could lead to coronary artery deposits (46). Reduced dietary calcium may cause calcium depletion in membrane storage sites resulting in less stability of vascular smooth muscle cell membranes, as optimal concentrations stabilize these membranes, inhibit calcium entry into cells, and reduce vasoconstriction (47). Other researchers suggest that gastrointestinal events associated with calcium supplements may account for an increase in self-reported cardiovascular events (18).\nObserved associations of dairy with overall prostate cancer risk may be related to the modulation of vitamin D metabolism by calcium and phosphorus (15) (31). Saturated fat in whole dairy correlating with higher C-peptide concentrations, along with obesity and hyperinsulinemia are proposed for associations of whole milk with fatal prostate cancer (31). Other suggested mechanisms include increasing levels of ionized calcium in the blood, as prostate cancer cells express both calcium-sensing receptors and calcium-dependent voltage-gated channels, the stimulation of which by extracellular calcium increases prostate cancer cell growth (44) (35). In African American men, positive associations between calcium and aggressive prostate cancer have been linked to single-nucleotide polymorphisms in the CDX-2 binding site of the VDR gene (32)."}

Calcium glucarate and other derivatives have been used to prevent and treat cancer. Patients with breast cancer often self-medicate with calcium glucarate supplements following surgery or adjunctive treatments. The glucarate component, not the calcium, is thought to account for its activity. Following administration, glucarate is converted to D-glucaro-1,4-lactone, which inhibits beta-glucuronidase (4).\nIn vitro and animal studies suggest that inhibition of beta-glucuronidase may prevent carcinogenesis (5), as well as initiation and promotion of cancer cells (3) (6). Increased elimination of carcinogens and hormones, including estrogen, has also been shown (2). In colon (7) and lung (8) cancer models, calcium glucarate administration exerted chemopreventive effects in the post-initiation phase of carcinogenesis. Dietary calcium glucarate also inhibited oral carcinogenesis (9). Topical calcium glucarate suppressed tumor development in murine skin tumors (6) (10) (11), and enhanced chemopreventive effects were achieved with a topical butyric acid, nicotinamide, and calcium glucarate combination (12) (13). A combination of topical ursolic acid and dietary calcium glucarate supplementation reduced skin tumor promotion and inflammatory signaling (14).\nPreliminary findings from a human study suggest that low glucaric acid levels and/or high beta-glucuronidase levels are markers of detoxification system impairment, and that calcium glucarate supplementation might reduce the cancer risk of some individuals (15).

This is further converted to D-glucaro-1,4-lactone, which is thought to inhibit beta-glucuronidase activity (4). Beta-glucuronidase has been shown to decrease the rate of elimination of estrogen and carcinogens such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and nitrosamines by deconjugation (3). Inhibition of beta-glucuronidase activity with calcium glucarate improves excretion of metabolized estrogen and carcinogens (2). D-glucarate can also be metabolized by gut bacteria, inhibit bacterial beta-glucuronidase, and potentially alter the enterohepatic cycle.\nIn animal studies, calcium glucarate reduced the quantity of benzo[a]pyrene-induced lung lesions with mutated K-ras and p53 genes in the post-initiation phase via DNA adduct removal, mutagenic suppression, and anti-inflammatory activity (8). Antitumorigenic effects of topical calcium glucarate may be due to stimulated differentiation via induction of transglutaminase activity and suppression of proliferation (6), as well as inhibition of thymidine kinase and aryl hydrocarbon hydroxylase activities, thus preventing carcinogen-DNA binding (10). Enhanced chemopreventive effects by a topical butyric acid, nicotinamide, and calcium glucarate combination used on murine skin tumors occurred via induced mitochondria-mediated apoptosis, upregulated p21, and downregulated Bcl-2, mut p53 (12). In another study this combination regulated miR-203 status through epigenetic or biogenetic modulations before and after tumor development to a greater degree than each of the individual compounds (13). Reduced epidermal hyperplasia with a combination of topical ursolic acid and dietary calcium glucarate supplementation caused a marked decrease in COX-2 and IL-6 expression (14).\nIn a preliminary human study, calcium glucarate supplementation suppressed beta-glucuronidase levels while increasing serum glucaric acid levels (15)."}

The photoprotective effect of topical gel formulations is thought to be associated with an improvement in collagen synthesis in the sub-epidermal connective tissue (15).

It has been used in traditional medical systems as a remedy to relieve muscle and arthritic pain and to treat cluster headaches and psoriasis. For these purposes, capsaicin is an active ingredient in some topical creams and nasal sprays. It is also available in a prescription-strength patch. Oral formulations are marketed largely for digestive and circulatory problems, poor appetite, and weight loss. (See Cayenne Pepper)\nStudies support benefits of topical low-concentration capsaicin formulations for psoriasis (1), prurigo nodularis (2), and pruritus ani (3). Although topical capsaicin has been included among conditional recommendations for osteoarthritis (4), its utility for rheumatoid arthritis remains inconclusive (5). An older clinical trial shows capsaicin 0.075% cream may control post-surgical pain in cancer patients (6). A case report in a palliative care patient using capsaicin 0.025% for opioid-refractory upper extremity pain also reported benefit (7).\nA high-concentration dermal capsaicin patch was shown safe and effective for postherpetic neuralgia (8), and was approved for prescription use. Data also show its effectiveness in controlling diabetic peripheral neuropathy (36), and providing sustained relief from heterogenous neuropathic pain (37) and neuropathic pain arising from radiculopathies (38). However, a subsequent application for HIV-associated neuropathic pain was rejected (9). A recent systematic review cites some benefit for both postherpetic neuralgia and HIV-neuropathy over controls. However, the patch is best used when other therapies have failed due to the small number of patients who may benefit (1 in 8) and unknown risks (10). Low-concentration capsaicin was determined as unlikely to have meaningful use for these conditions in clinical practice (11). Data are also limited in patients with post-mastectomy neuropathy (12).\nA preliminary study suggests improved swallowing function in elderly patients with dysphagia when 0.025% capsaicin ointment was applied to the external auditory canal (43). In other reports, several case series suggest topical capsaicin can be effective for cannabis-associated hyperemesis (39) (42). Only a few small studies suggest intranasal capsaicin of divergent formulations may be helpful for rhinitis (13) (14), and its effectiveness for cluster headaches is unknown (15).\nThere is continued controversy over whether capsaicin acts as a carcinogen, co-carcinogen, or anti-carcinogen (16) (17) (18). For example, capsaicin has demonstrated chemopreventive and antiproliferative effects against various cell lines including breast (19), bladder (20), prostate cancer cells (21). Also, a small study suggests utility of a high-concentration dermal capsaicin patch in relieving pain associated with chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) (40). However, long-term topical application was shown to increase skin carcinogenesis in mice treated with a tumor promoter (18), although such effects may be concentration-dependent (22). Therefore, more studies are needed to clarify the roles of capsaicin in relationship to cancer.", "food_sources": "Cayenne peppers, hot sauces containing chili peppers", "mechanism_of_action": "The analgesic effect of capsaicin is multifactorial. It depolarizes C-fiber polymodal nociceptors (23) (24). This causes the release of substance P, the neurotransmitter that relays pain signals to the brain (25), which causes an initial increase in pain. With repeated application, pain subsides due to the eventual depletion of substance P at the afferent neurons (26). Capsaicin also activates transient receptor potential vanilloid subfamily member 1 (TRPV1, also known as the capsaicin receptor) (27), causing selective and reversible defunctionalization of cutaneous sensory nerve endings expressing TRPV1 (28).\nImproved swallowing function in elderly dysphagic patients, particularly glottal closure and cough reflex, was attributed to TRPV1-mediated aural stimulation of vagal Arnold\u2019s nerve with capsaicin ointment (43). \nStudies on various cancer cell lines have shown that capsaicin demonstrates chemopreventive properties by causing cell-cycle arrest and inducing apoptosis, or by generating reactive oxygen species (ROS) and depolarizing mitochondrial membranes, and through caspase activation (17) (19) (20). Alternatively, the co-carcinogenic effect of capsaicin on chemically-induced skin carcinogenesis is mediated through the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), but not TRPV1 (18). Further exploration of caspaicin-induced apoptosis, in glioma cells, found inhibition of autophagy to be a likely contributor (34). Interestingly, capsaicin was also shown to induce autophagy by enhancing the levels of autophagy markers LC3-II and Atg5, increasing p62 and Fap-1 degradation and increasing caspase-3 activity to induce apoptosis in human nasopharyngeal carcinoma cells (41)."}

It can be found in diets that include meat, or synthesized endogenously from lysine and methionine. Deficiencies can be caused by genetic disorders, malnutrition, malabsorption, and kidney dialysis. These can affect the heart, skeletal muscles, liver, nerve, and endocrine functions. Carnitine is marketed as a dietary supplement to enhance physical performance and to treat fatigue, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, obesity, chronic fatigue syndrome, liver disorders, and cancer.\nAnimal models suggest that L-carnitine has cardioprotective (8) (14) and antioxidant effects (31). It may help prevent cardiovascular disease in hemodialysis patients (24). Long-term carnitine supplementation in humans is correlated with improved myocardial mechanical performance, reduction in ventricular arrhythmias, and increased exercise tolerance (7). However, L-carnitine administration did not improve risk of death or heart failure in patients with anterior acute myocardial infarction (36).\nPreliminary results suggest L-carnitine may improve symptoms of chronic fatigue syndrome (22) and physical performance in patients undergoing dialysis for end-stage renal disease (9), but data of its benefits in alleviating fatigue associated with multiple sclerosis are inconclusive (21). Several trials have shown enhanced physical performance (17) (20), and improved aerobic capacity and exercise tolerance (32). Other studies show mixed results (37) (38) (39) and its clinical value and safety needs additional study.\nL-carnitine used by itself or in combination with clomiphene citrate may help in the treatment against idiopathic male infertility (25), although it did not improve sperm count or motility (40). Oral carnitine supplementation may improve mental health parameters and biomarkers of oxidative stress in women with polycystic ovary syndrome (2).\nThere are studies looking into the effects of carnitine in cancer patients. L-carnitine supplementation improved nutritional status and quality of life in pancreatic cancer patients (27). Other preliminary data show that L-carnitine by itself (15) (23) or in combination with Coenzyme Q10 (33) may relieve chemotherapy-related fatigue. L-carnitine also demonstrated benefits against fatigue both in younger hypothyroid patients receiving levothyroxine and thyroid cancer patients who have hypothyroidism post-surgery (41). However, carnitine does not improve fatigue in patients with invasive malignancies (28). Carnitine may inhibit cisplatin-induced injury of the kidney and small intestine (13). Additional studies are needed to determine the cancer populations in which carnitine supplementation may be most beneficial.\nAn ester derivative, acetyl-L-carnitine, is also available as a dietary supplement and is often used as a neuroprotective agent. It may help to reduce diabetic neuropathy (42) (43) or improve cognition in patients with severe hepatic encephalopathy (44). In elderly patients with dysthymic disorder, it was found to be comparable with fluoxetine (45); however, other studies did not find it effective for Alzheimer\u2019s disease (46) (47). One study actually showed that acetyl-L-carnitine can increase chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) (35). Therefore, patients receiving chemotherapy should avoid this product.", "food_sources": "Meat, dairy products, beans, avocado", "mechanism_of_action": "Carnitine is a non-essential amino acid, with only the L-isomer utilized in human bodies. It is available in many foods, and bioavailability from dietary sources is much higher (54\u201387%) than from oral supplements (14%\u201318%) (48). L-carnitine plays a role in the transport of long chain fatty acids across the inner mitochondrial membrane, facilitating beta-oxidation of fatty acids and acting as an intracellular energy reservoir of acetyl groups. In deficiencies, these acyl esters accumulate and cause deleterious effects including inhibition of adenine nucleotide translocase, which impedes ATP production (5). Carnitine supplementation prevents oxidative stress and ameliorates mitochondrial function (29). L-carnitine demonstrated a protective effect against statin-induced cellular damage via its anti-oxidative properties in rat hepatocytes (31).\nAnimal studies show L-carnitine has cardioprotective effects by preventing skeletal muscle myopathy (14). In hemodialysis patients, carnitine has antiinflammatory and anticoagulation effects which may contribute to its cardioprotective activity (24).\nIn cardiac disease models, carnitine supplementation improved cardiac performance including improved myocardial metabolic patterns, reduced necrosis, diminished enzymatic infarct size, and preserved left ventricular function (8). Its effects on congestive heart failure-associated myopathy may be due to caspase inhibition and decreased TNF-alpha levels (14). Metabolism of dietary L-carnitine by intestinal microbiota produced trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO), a proatherogenic species, which accelerated atherosclerosis (30).\nCarnitine is often proposed for the treatment of obesity and metabolic syndrome. Possible mechanisms include inhibition of stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1 activity, \u03b2-oxidation of fatty acids, and increased storage in the body tissues (49).\nAnimal studies show L-carnitine has anticatabolic effects by improving nitrogen balance either via increased protein synthesis or reduced protein degradation. Other studies show it prevents oxidative stress and ameliorates mitochondrial function (29). It may help cancer-related cachexia by reducing proteasome activity (50). Clinical trials are needed to determine the implications of this study in humans.\nIn one trial, carnitine was shown to be effective in reversing hyperthyroidism by acting as a peripheral antagonist of thyroid hormone action (3)."}

Family: Solanaceae", "warnings": " ", "clinical_summary": "Derived from the fruit of Capsicum, cayenne is among the most widely consumed culinary spice. Traditionally, it is used as a gargle for laryngitis and orally as a gastrointestinal stimulant. Oral formulations are marketed largely for digestive and circulatory problems, poor appetite, and weight loss. The active component, capsaicin, is also marketed for topical use to relieve various types of pain and for certain skin conditions (See Capsaicin topical formulations).\nCapsaicin may increase insulin and decrease blood glucose levels (1). Nonpungent capsaicin analogues can produce a stimulatory effect in humans, but their potential role in energy expenditure and weight management problems needs further clarification (2) (3) (4). In addition, the thermogenic and appetitive effects of capsaicin have been determined to be small (5). Oral capsaicin administered to participants in one study enhanced salty taste sensations, thereby lowering daily salt intake and subsequent blood pressure (29). A preliminary study of enteric-coated oral capsaicin suggests it may decrease visceral hyperalgesia and improve bloating in patients with irritable bowel syndrome (6). Supplementation with capsicum for burning mouth syndrome is associated with significant side effects (7).\nAnother study of oral capsaicin suggests that it can alleviate oral mucositis pain from cancer therapy, but this relief was temporary and not complete (8). There is continued controversy over whether active constituents of capsicum act as a carcinogen, co-carcinogen, or anti-carcinogen (9) (10) (11) (12) , and effects may be concentration-dependent (9). In vitro studies have shown cytotoxic effects against breast (13), bladder (14), prostate (15), and oral cancer cell lines (16), and multidrug-resistant lymphoma (17). However, a human case-control study suggests an increased risk for gastric cancer with dietary capsaicin (18). Therefore, more studies are needed to clarify the roles of capsaicin in relationship to cancer.", "food_sources": "Fruits of capsicum pepper", "mechanism_of_action": "Capsaicin is the compound responsible for the irritant effects of capsicum (10). Perceived heat from capsaicin when ingesting cayenne is caused by activation of transient receptor potential vanilloid subfamily member 1 (TRPV1), located in neurons on the tongue (4). Capsinoids lack this sensory quality because they are hydrolyzed as they cross the oral mucosa (4). Potential thermogenic effects also involve activation of TRPV1 receptors on vagal afferents in the gut (4). Capsaicin may induce energy expenditure by enhancing core body and skin temperature and influencing substrate oxidation, but these effects can vary with body composition (3) (5). In response to high-salt stimuli, oral capsaicin administration enhanced insula and orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) metabolic activity in participants, reversing salt intensity-dependent differences in the metabolism of the insula and OFC (29).\nIt was also found to induce coronary vasodilation by releasing calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), a potent vasodilator. Depletion in CGRP leads to a subsequent increase in blood pressure (21). Interactions between capsaicin and cyclosporin indicate the ability of capsaicin to modulate P-gp and CYP3A gene expression and to also increase cyclosporin bioavailability via CYP3A inhibition (22). Lignan glycosides isolated from capsicum pepper were also shown to have strong scavenging activity against the free radical, DPPH (20).\nIn vitro and animal studies indicate capsaicin causes cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis in both ER+ and ER\u2212 breast cancer cells by modulating the EGFR/HER-2 pathway (13). Orally administered capsaicin also slowed the growth of PC-3 prostate cancer cells in mice by downregulating expression of androgen receptors and by a direct inhibitory effect on prostate specific antigen transcription (15). In bladder cancer, capsaicin mediates cell death through reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and mitochondrial depolarization (14). Conversely, in certain concentrations, capsaicin may promote colorectal cancer metastasis by triggering ROS production and modulating Akt/mTOR and STAT-3 pathways (9)."}

Chitosan is used as an excipient in pharmaceutical formulations and in biomedical applications including wound dressings. It is also made into an edible film to protect food from spoilage (1). Chitosan is marketed as an all-natural marine fiber for weight loss management and to manage cholesterol.\nAnimal models suggest antiobesity properties with chitosan (14) (15) (16) (17) and derivative products (18) (19). In one animal study, a combination of capsaicin and chitosan increased this activity (20).\nFindings from human studies are conflicting. Although marketers of weight loss supplements claim that chitosan can bind with fat in the intestine, some clinical trials did not find any increase in fecal excretion of fat or weight loss compared with placebo (2) (3) (4) (21). Other studies have had more positive results in combination with additional products or interventions. In a double-blind randomized controlled trial (RCT), polyglucosamine, a low molecular weight chitosan, along with a low-calorie diet and increased exercise for at least 6 months yielded additional weight loss compared with placebo and the same diet/lifestyle changes (22). Chitosan in combination with L-ascorbic acid produced some effects on bodyweight in overweight women, but there were no significant differences in fat mass, percentage body fat, body circumference, or skinfold thickness compared with placebo control (23). One single-blind RCT of fungal chitosan found significant bodyweight reductions and improved hemoglobin A1c, body composition, and anthropometric parameters in overweight/obese adults without diet restriction compared with placebo after 3 months (24). Howevever, due to heterogeneity of studies and mixed results, more trials are needed before definitive conclusions can be drawn.\nIn diabetic patients, chitosan reduced low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol (6), and decreased weight, body mass index (BMI), waist circumference, and triglycerides (7). A systematic review also concluded that chitosan reduces total cholesterol, but larger RCTs are necessary to determine its effect on other lipoproteins (8).\nChitosan may increase total plasma antioxidant activity and lower the indices of oxidative stress in humans (9). Limited clinical data are available regarding efficacy for anemia or chronic renal failure, although chitosan did show benefit in a small randomized study (10).\nReported adverse events include constipation and gastrointestinal distress (2).

It has been described as biodegradable, nontoxic, non-immunogenic, and biocompatible (25), with properties similar to cellulose (2).\nIn an in vitro study, chitosan demonstrated antioxidant effects by reducing albumin carobonyls and hydroperoxides in a time-dependent manner (9).\nIn animal models, antiobesity effects may occur through serum leptin and C-reactive protein modulation (14) or 5\u2019 adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activation and lipogenesis-associated gene inhibition (15). In porcine models, chitosan altered genes influencing appetite and feeding behavior in the small intestine (NPY), adipose tissue (Leptin), and the brain (HCRT, INSR, NMB, GHR, PPARG, NPY5R) (17). It also downregulated FABP2 gene expression, increased serum leptin, and significantly altered gut microbial populations (16). In high-fat diet-induced obese rodents, chitosan oligosaccharides improved dyslipidemia and prevented body weight gain by inhibiting adipocyte differentiation (19). As an insoluble fiber, low molecular weight chitosan polyglucosamines can bind to fat in the intestinal lumen, forming a complex that is partially utilized by colon bacteria and partially eliminated (22) (26) (27), but appropriate concentrations are needed. In one of these animal studies, it was suggested that the more likely mechanisms for weight loss could include bacterial energy wasting, as increased acetate and glucose excretion were also present, suggesting that larger amounts of lipids and glucose were available as fuel for bacteria in the colon (26).\nHypocholesterolemic effects from chitosan in murine models were not due to reduced cholesterol absorption efficiency or increases in fecal sterol output, so that a major bile acid-binding capacity was ruled out (28). The more likely scenario is that the fiber\u2019s influence on satiation and satiety reduces food intake suppression and therefore cholesterol (29).\nHuman studies suggest that it is unlikely that chitosan binds fat in intestines, and could therefore not support this purported mechanism of action (21) (30).\nTopical application enhances wound healing by stimulation of granulation tissue. Possible mechanisms include formation of a gel-like fibronectin matrix that facilitates inward epithelial cell migration and the formation of heparin-chitosan complexes that activate growth factors that bind to stabilized heparin (12)."}

Trivalent chromium from yeast extract is sometimes referred to as glucose tolerance factor (GTF) in over-the-counter products.\nAlthough most people consume adequate amounts through diet, chromium deficiency has been implicated in the development of diabetes (25). In vitro studies suggest that chromium produces beneficial modulatory effects under hyperglycemic conditions (26). Animal models also suggest antidiabetic (27) (28), antidepressant (29) (30) (31), and anxiolytic (32) properties.\nIn human studies, chromium supplementation with biotin may help to improve glycemic control in type 2 diabetes (T2D) (4) (5) (6). In a trial of patients with poorly controlled T2D, chromium supplementation had beneficial effects on glycemic control without affecting lipid profiles (33). Another study showed that chromium picolinate may increase satiety (15). However, many clinical studies failed to demonstrate a beneficial effect of chromium on glucose metabolism, weight loss, or muscle mass improvement (3) (7) (8) (9) (10) (11) (12) (13) (14).\nDue to lack of clinical evidence, the FDA stated that chromium picolinate did not reduce the risk of insulin resistance or type-2 diabetes (16). More recently, the debate has continued, with one meta-analysis determining that overall, chromium monosupplementation significantly improved glycemic control, increased HDL-C levels, and reduced triglycerides (34), while another meta-analysis determined that chromium picolinate did not significantly affect A1C, and had no effect on fasting plasma glucose (35). Other clinicians posit that the mixed and modest effect sizes seen with chromium supplementation may reflect a greater glucoregulatory effect in complex patients with comorbid diabetes, depression, and binge eating (36). A large population study determined that those who consumed chromium-containing supplements had a reduced risk of T2D compared with those who did not, and warranted further study given the magnitude of exposure (37).\nIn other studies, chromium picolinate supplementation improved cerebral and memory function in elderly patients with early memory decline (17), produced antidepressant effects in patients with atypical depression (38), and improved mood symptoms in patients with premenstrual dysphoric disorder (39).\nChromium is poorly absorbed following oral administration, but salt forms such as chromium picolinate, niacin-bound chromium, and chromium chloride, appear to have better bioavailability.

In vitro and in vivo studies suggest that chromium potentiates the activity of insulin (23) (42). This is thought to occur via enhanced intracellular tyrosine kinase activity that results from an interaction between chromium, low molecular weight chromium-binding substance, and activated cell surface insulin receptors (2).\nIn animal models of diabetes, chromium recovered beta cell functioning and alleviated macroangiopathy (27). It also augmented the insulin signaling pathway, dulled negative-regulators of insulin signaling, enhanced adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activity to increase cellular glucose uptake, and attenuated oxidative stress (42). Chromium may also modulate peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPAR-gamma), insulin receptor substrate (IRS-1), and nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-\u03baB) proteins (28). Antidepressant effects occur via modified brain 5-hydroxytryptamine receptor (5-HT) function and increased serotonergic and noradrenergic functioning (30) (31). Additional mechanisms for antidepressant and anxiolytic effects include the lowering of plasma corticosterone levels via reversal of hypothalamic\u2013pituitary\u2013adrenal axis (HPA) axis overactivity (32).

It is found in all human cells, at higher concentrations in the liver, kidney, heart, and pancreas. It is also consumed as a dietary supplement for its antioxidant effects and is often promoted as a preventive agent for cardiovascular diseases, Parkinson\u2019s disease, infertility and cancer. Studies using murine models indicate antioxidant and neuroprotective effects (17) (18),  and the ability to alleviate radiation-induced nephropathy (34).\nData from some studies suggest beneficial effects of CoQ10 in patients with coronary artery disease (2), congestive heart failure (21), and for reducing risk of cardiovascular mortality (42). But a systematic review concluded that current evidence does not support CoQ10 supplementation in patients with coronary heart disease (43). Supplementation may increase sperm motility in asthenozoospermic men (8); modulate expression of insulin, lipid and inflammatory markers in women with polycystic ovary syndrome (POCS) (35); and reduce fatigue induced by physical exertion (9). In addition, neuroprotective effects were reported in patients with progressive supranuclear palsy (5) as well as those with early Parkinson\u2019s disease (6) (33), but not in patients with mid-stage Parkinson\u2019s disease (7). Case reports also suggest that CoQ10 supplementation improves postural hypotension, a hallmark of multiple-system atrophy (36) and adjuvant CoQ10 was shown to improve symptoms of depression in patients with bipolar disorder (44). But a mixture of antioxidants, including CoQ10, vitamins C, E, and lipoic acid was found ineffective against Alzheimer\u2019s disease (20).\nCoQ10 may also play a role in preventing migraines (22). A small study showed a reduction in the frequency of migraine headaches following supplementation (23), but a randomized trial failed to find benefit (24). More research is warranted. Further, the observation that patients on statin therapy have decreased concentrations of CoQ10 in muscle cells (25) resulted in efforts to evaluate the benefit of CoQ10 in alleviating statin-induced myalgias. Data are inconclusive (26) (27) (28) (45).\n\nCoQ10 has also been investigated for anticancer effects. In a study of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma, coenzyme Q10 levels were positively associated with antioxidant capacity and negatively correlated with inflammation markers, post surgery (37), suggesting a role for CoQ10 as an antioxidant therapy. In studies of breast cancer patients, a combination of CoQ10 and L-carnitine was found effective in controlling moderate-severe cancer-related fatigue (CRF) (38). And according to case reports, supplementation may be useful for treating the cancer (3) (4), although a randomized trial reported no benefit in improving self-reported fatigue or quality of life (29). Further research is needed (39).\n\nCoQ10 may interfere with the actions of warfarin (11) (12).

All cells are capable of synthesizing CoQ10 and no redistribution between organs occurs through the blood. It is necessary for adenosine triphosphate (ATP) production, and its role as a mobile electron carrier in the mitochondrial electron-transfer processes of respiration and coupled phosphorylation is well established. It also has a direct regulatory role on succinyl and NADH dehydrogenases (1). CoQ10 has been shown to scavenge free radicals produced by lipid peroxidation and prevent mitochondrial deformity during episodes of ischemia, and it may help maintain the integrity of myocardial calcium ion channels during ischemic insults (2). CoQ10 may also be capable of stabilizing cellular membranes and preventing depletion of metabolites required for ATP resynthesis (10), and suppressing age-related inflammatory reactions and osteoclast differentiation by inhibiting oxidative stress (30).\nOne of the mechanisms underlying the neuroprotective effects of CoQ10 involves inhibition of microglia in pentylenetetrazol-induced kindling epilepsy in mice (40).\n\nIn addition, CoQ10 was shown to prevent the reduction of glucose transporter-4 (GLUT4) protein levels in adipocytes caused by simvastatin, which is a likely mechanism against statin-induced diabetes (31). It also reduced high glucose-induced apoptosis and dysfunction of endothelial progenitor cells by up-regulating endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) and heme oxygenase (HO-1) through the AMP-activated protein kinase pathway (41). In a  murine model, it was shown to afford protection against doxorubicin-induced testicular toxicity by ameliorating oxidative stress, reducing apoptosis and by up-regulating testicular P-glycoprotein (32)."}

In human skeletal muscle, CLA enhanced the rate of glycogen resynthesis after exercise (43).\nIt is thought that replacing other polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) with CLA may reduce oxidative stress and modulate intracellular signaling (11).

The cis-9,trans-11 isomer induced tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase (TIMP)-1 and TIMP-2 mRNA in SGC-7901 human gastric carcinoma cells, which may play a role in inhibiting the tumor metastasis cascade (2). This inhibition may come from blocking the cell cycle with reduced expressions of cyclin A, B1 and D1 and enhanced cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor (CDKI) expression (17).\nIn animal models of colorectal cancer, suppression of disease activity was attributed to peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARy) activation (36). Other possible mechanisms include increased apoptosis and enhanced caspase-3 activity in the colon mucosa (37).

PSP also increased apoptotic cell death in cells treated with camptothecin, reduced cellular proliferation, inhibited cell progression through S and G2 phases of DNA replication, reduced 3H-thymidine uptake, and prolonged DNA synthesis time (14). A medicinal mushroom blend that included Coriolus inhibited cell proliferation and induced cell cycle arrest at the G2/M phase in an invasive human breast cancer cell line  (15). DNA-microarray analysis indicates the mushroom extract inhibits expression of cell-cycle regulatory genes and suppresses metastatic behavior via inhibition of cell adhesion, migration, and invasion. Inhibition of metastatic behavior was linked to suppression of urokinase plasminogen activator (15). PSP also inhibits interaction between HIV-1 gp120 and CD4 receptor, HIV-1 transcriptase activity, and glycohydrolase enzyme activity associated with viral glycosylation (16).\nSeveral animal studies report synergy between PSK and biologic therapies, including a concanavalin A-bound L1210 vaccine and the IgG2a monoclonal antibody against human colon cancer cells (17). PSP induces cytokine production and T-cell proliferation, and prevents cyclophosphamide-induced immune suppression.

The processed fruit and juice, both rich in vitamin C, are widely consumed as food. The juice extract is marketed as a dietary supplement for urinary tract health and to prevent urinary tract infections (UTIs). It has also been used for oral and gastrointestinal infections, cardiovascular diseases, and against cancer. In preclinical studies, cranberry juice extracts and constituents exhibited antibacterial (1), antimicrobial (45), antifungal (46), anti-inflammatory (47), antioxidant (48), and antiadherence (49) properties.\nClinical studies demonstrate that cranberry extracts can help prevent UTIs in adults (2) (3), children (4), in prostate cancer patients undergoing radiation therapy (5) (50), and in patients following urostomy (68). A large double-blind study of older adults with high-baseline UTI risk also showed benefit (51), but another similar study reported negative findings (52). A subsequent analysis revealed increased costs with no meaningful reduction in UTI rates in a geriatric nursing home environment (53). Studies of cranberry juice for recurrent UTIs have also been mixed, with one study finding no benefit among college-aged women (6), and another observing significant reductions in UTI relapse in women over age 50 (54). Cranberry was not as effective or cost-effective as trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole in preventing UTIs in premenopausal women, but patients were less likely to develop antibiotic-resistant bacteria (8) (55). In volunteers from different regions, anti-adhesion activity with cranberry powder was found to be dose-dependent (7) . Overall, a systematic review determined that cranberry juice was more effective than capsules or tablets  (56), but despite some support for recurrent UTI prophylaxis (69), there is not enough evidence to recommend cranberry juice for UTI prevention (9) (70).\nIn other studies, cranberry juice inhibited the adhesion of H. pylori to human gastric mucosa (18), and regular consumption may suppress H. pylori infection (19) (20), a major factor in peptic ulcer disease and gastric cancer. When used with standard treatment, cranberry juice helped eradicate H. pylori (21). It was shown to prevent plaque formation and the development of gum disease as well due to its anticolonizing and antiadhesion properties (22) (23).\nCranberry extracts and proanthocyanidins also exhibited antiproliferative effects against prostate (10) (11) (12), liver (13), lung (57), neuroblastoma (58), breast (14), ovarian (15), gastric (59), colon (12) (16), esophageal (60), and oral (12) cancer cells. Although cranberry juice consumption did not lower oxidative status in humans, suggesting lack of protective effect against cancer or heart disease (17), it did appear to improve cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors in diabetic men (61). However, cranberry juice has high concentrations of oxalate, a common component of kidney stones, and should be limited in patients with a history of nephrolithiasis (40). Other data suggest it may be helpful in uncommon forms including struvite stones, which are associated with bladder infections (33) (62) (63).", "food_sources": "Cranberry can be consumed as juice, sauce, or dried fruit.", "mechanism_of_action": "The A-type linkages in cranberry proanthocyanidins C-PACs may enhance urinary bacterial antiadhesion activities to prevent UTIs (25) (26) (27) (28) (64). Similarly, the bioactivity against C. albicans biofilm formation is due to anti-adherence properties and/or iron chelation (46). In susceptible populations, improved preventive effects with cranberry juice over capsules or tablets may be related to better hydration with liquid, and/or additive effects with additional compounds in juice not contained in supplements (56). Anti-adhesion properties were also demonstrated in other microenvironments. Cranberry prevented H. pylori-induced stomach ulcers by inhibiting bacterial adhesions in the stomach lining (18) (29), decreased adherence of oral streptococci strains to saliva-coated hydroxyapatite (23) and glucan-coated hydroxyapatite, and impaired biofilm formation (22) (30) indicating it may slow development of dental plaque and protect against plaque-related diseases. Cranberry also regulated aggressive human periodontitis fibroblast inflammatory responses via nuclear factor-kappaB and matrix metalloproteinase-3 (MMP3) inhibition (47).\nAdditional studies have shown that C-PACs may play a role in enhancing host innate immunity. In a worm model, a standardized cranberry extract mediated host immune response via p38 MAPK signaling, insulin/insulin-like growth factor 1 signaling, and heat shock factor 1 (45). Antiatherogenic effects of cranberry juice occur via reductions in serum glucose and apoB, and increases in serum and apoA-1 and paraoxonase, associated with stabilizing HDL (61).\nMechanisms underlying the anticancer effects of cranberry extracts and C-PACs have also been investigated. A cranberry extract inhibited prostate cancer cell growth by decreasing cyclins, cyclin-dependant kinase expression (10) , and MMP activity (31). Dose-response inhibition of gastric cancer cells to cranberry is in part due to decreased proliferating cell nuclear antigen expression and apoptotic induction (59). A proanthocyanidin isolate was shown to arrest ovarian cancer cell growth by inhibiting vascular endothelial growth factor and generating reactive oxygen species (15). C-PACs were also found to induce cell death in esophageal adenocarcinoma via microRNA modifications within cancer cells (60), and in human lung cancer cells, they altered gene expression, induced apoptosis, and modulated cell-cycle processes (57). In high-risk neuroblastoma cells, a purified C-PAC induced apoptosis and ROS generation, and encouraged cyclophosphamide retention with synergistic cytotoxic benefits (58).\nCranberry juice increases the risk of uric acid stone formation because of its acidifying effect and slowing of urate synthesis, thereby decreasing urinary pH (32) (33)."}

Both are precursors for other hormones, including estrogen and androgens (1). Animal studies indicate that DHEA may have chemopreventive effects (2) (3), blocks the development of tumors (4), and enhances immune response following hepatitis (5) and influenza (6) vaccinations. Although it has been postulated that DHEA may play a role in increasing immune response in acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) (7), no antiviral or immunostimulatory effects were observed in HIV-positive participants receiving DHEA (8).\n\nIn clinical trials, DHEA was shown effective in treating Addison\u2019s disease (13) (14) (15) (16) (17), major depression (9), schizophrenia-induced anxiety (10), systematic lupus erythematosus (11), osteoporosis (12), and erectile dysfunction (13). Topical application of DHEA in postmenopausal women resulted in increased sebum production and epidermal thickening in the hands and face (18). However, other studies did not find effectivess of DHEA in treating Alzheimer\u2019s disease (19), obesity in adolescents (20), or perimenopausal symptoms (21). Furthermore, DHEA does not increase muscle mass (22) or physical performance (23), enhance insulin secretion or action (24), or improve cognitive performance (25) in elderly individuals.  DHEA supplementation, believed to enhance physical strength, did not improve physical performance or quality of life in a study done in older men and women (26). However conflicting data suggest improvements in cognitive (43) and physical function (44) in older women. DHEA has been used to treat sexual dysfunction in postmenopausal women. But results from clinical studies are mixed (28) (29). Whether DHEA is effective for treating adrenal insufficiency is not clear (41) (42).\n\nDHEA alters some of the activities of the cytochrome P-450 enzyme that metabolizes several drugs (3). In premenopausal women, high levels of DHEA have been associated with increased risk of ovarian (7) and breast (27) cancers. High DHEA-S levels have also been shown to contribute to tamoxifen resistance and disease progression in breast cancer (28). A case of cancer flare-up was reported in a patient with advanced prostate cancer undergoing DHEA treatment (29).", "food_sources": " ", "mechanism_of_action": "DHEA is an endogenous hormone secreted by the adrenal cortex in response to adrenocorticotropin. DHEA is metabolized into androstenedione in the body and may be further converted into either testosterone or estrogen. Low levels of endogenous DHEA have been associated with the following disease states: burn trauma, coronary artery disease, non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, obsessive-compulsive disorder, rheumatoid arthritis, and systemic lupus erythematosus (5). Endogenous DHEA concentration peaks around 20 years of age and declines with age.\n\nDHEA has been shown to stimulate insulin growth factor-1 (1). G6PD is necessary for nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) production. DHEA has also been shown to increase levels of interleukin-2 in animal models (7). DHEA reduces the effects of inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-6, which are thought to reduce flares in systemic lupus erythematosus (11). Numerous studies have reported an inverse relationship between DHEA concentration and cardiovascular disease (5). DHEA administration improved mental function scores in patients with advanced HIV infection (32), enhanced influenza vaccination in elderly patients (6), and decreased oxidative stress markers in patients with type II diabetes in part by negatively influencing TNF-alpha signaling (33). Although DHEA-S concentration does not appear to be correlated with cognitive decline in aging men (34), the anti-depressive effects of DHEA may be mediated by GABAA receptor modulation (35). DHEA has also been shown to affect cytochrome P-450 enzymes in the liver (3). The exact effect that this will have on other drugs remains unclear.\n\nAnalogs of DHEA that cannot be converted to androgens and estrogens have been developed and have demonstrated anti-proliferative effects (7) (31). DHEA inhibits glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) in vitro and blocks the development of tumors in mice (4). It was also shown to induce authophagic cell death in human hepatoma cells via a mitogen activated protein kinase (JNK)-transciption factor (Nrf2)-protein complex p62 axis (46).But an increase in concentration of sex hormones including DHEA has been shown to increase the risk of breast cancer (30). And prolonged intake of DHEA in postmenopausal women may increase the risk of breast cancer particularly in obese subjects (36).

Physiologist Luigi Di Bella developed the regimen and promotes it as an effective treatment for cancer, retinitis pigmentosa, multiple sclerosis, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and Alzheimer\u2019s disease. Treatment is tailored to the individual patient, and purportedly stimulates the body\u2019s self-healing without the toxicity of conventional chemotherapy.\n\nDi Bella multitherapy is based on the theory that growth hormone (GH) and prolactin are involved in neoplastic growth. Somatostatin and its analog octreotide inhibit the secretion of GH and IGF-1 in humans (1), while bromocriptine is a prolactin inhibitor (6). This treatment was very popular in Italy in the late 1990s as Di Bella claimed he cured thousands on an outpatient basis and physicians in other countries, such as Canada, also prescribed it. The treatment was also highly publicized and politicized in Italy, raising the issue of \u201cfreedom of treatment\u201d for patients who could not afford the expensive regimen. In response, local judges ordered that somatostatin be added to the list of effective reimbursable medications (21) (22), and the Italian National Institute of Health supported 11 separate open-label uncontrolled phase II studies of 8 different cancers, organized by Di Bella and the National Cancer Advisory Committee (20). These trials found no complete responses (23) (24), 0.8% partial response rate, and considerable toxicity (12) (18). However, an uncontrolled study of 20 patients with late stage non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma had a 70% response rate with a similar regimen (6).\nAdverse effects include increased pain at tumor site, nausea, vomiting, anorexia, diarrhea, and somnolence (6). Somatostatin may reduce or eliminate the efficacy of painkillers (e.g., methadone, morphine) (11).", "food_sources": " ", "mechanism_of_action": "The Di Bella Multitherapy is based on the theory that growth hormone (GH) and prolactin are involved in neoplastic growth, particularly in lymphomas and leukemias. The following components have been studied, but their combined activities and at the Di Bella doses are unknown.\n\nSomatostatin inhibits growth hormone (GH) secretion. Its synthetic analog, octreotide, shows antineoplastic activity in vitro and in vivo, and is used clinically for the treatment of acromegaly and neuroendocrine tumors. Their biological effects are mediated via high affinity plasma membrane receptors that are found throughout the body and on many human tumors. Clinical studies show a reduction in serum IGF-1 and IGF-1 gene expression after treatment with octreotide (1). Somatostatin and analogs also enhance secretion and expression of IGF-binding protein-1, which negatively regulates plasma IGF-1, while inhibiting mitogens and secretion of gastrointestinal hormones implicated in tumor growth. Somatostatin analogs also show immune-modulating activity in vitro and inhibit angiogenesis and directly induce cell growth arrest and apoptosis in vivo and in vitro (7).\n\nMelatonin is a free-radical scavenger and displays anti-proliferative effects on various cancer cell lines in vitro, but no human studies show evidence of anti-tumor activity. Melatonin shows antimyelodysplastic activity and reduces bone marrow toxicity of chemotherapeutic agents in animal models. See melatonin for additional information (2) (3) (4) (5).\n\nBromocriptine is a dopamine agonist and prolactin inhibitor. Prolactin stimulates growth of lymphomas in vivo and in vitro, and prolactin receptors are present on normal and neoplastic lymphoid cells.\nRetinoids act as antioxidants and immunostimulants, cause cell growth arrest in B-cell lymphomas in vitro, and have shown benefit in trials of promyelotic leukemia and cutaneous T-cell lymphoma.\nACTH receptors can be found on T and B lymphocytes and ACTH has been seen to depress lymphocyte blastogenesis and modulate NK cell activity in vitro (6)."}

However, these effects have not been evaluated in humans.\nData from an epidemiologic study suggest that dong quai consumption is associated with reduced risk of subsequent endometrial cancer in breast cancer survivors (39). However, clinical trial data regarding efficacy of dong quai for menopausal symptoms are inconclusive (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) (6) (29) (33). A small study done in men with hot flashes did not find dong quai effective (31).\n\nDong quai exhibits estrogenic activity in vitro (15) and stimulates proliferation of MCF-7 cells (16) (17). Until definitive efficacy and safety data are available, patients with hormone-sensitive cancers should avoid this herb.", "food_sources": " ", "mechanism_of_action": "Ferulic acid, a constituent of dong quai, may play an important role in treating osteoarthritis by reducing hydrogen peroxide-induced interleukin IL-1beta, tumor necrosis factor TNF-alpha, matrix metalloproteinases MMP-1 and MMP-13, and by increasing SOX9 gene expression. SOX9 is a protein involved in the establishment and maintenance of the phenotype of chondrocytes  (35). Dong quai polysaccharides demonstrated anti-osteoarthritic activity by stimulating insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1) and IGF1 receptor gene expression, thereby promoting UDP-sugars and glycosaminoglycan synthesis (37). Another compound promotes wound healing and bone regeneration by inducing osteoblast proliferation and hyaluronic acid deposition (25).\n\nAn aqueous extract from dong quai was reported to have estrogen-agonist activity, and stimulated proliferation of both estrogen receptor-positive and -negative breast cancer cells (17). It also protected against radiation-induced pneumonitis by downregulating proinflammatory cytokines such as TNF-alpha and TGF-beta1 in a murine model (14). Subcutaneous injection of dong quai extract protected mice against cyclophosphamide-induced cytotoxicity by promoting recovery from leukopenia (12). The antitumor effects of dong quai may be due to its inhibitory effects on invasion and metastasis of carcinoma cells (9) and by suppression of tumor growth (7) (8) (10) that may be mediated by Nur77-dependent apoptosis (23) (24). However, dong quai extracts also promote angiogenesis \u2013 which plays a key role in both physiologic and disease processes \u2013 by inducing proliferation and migration of endothelial cells by upregulating VEGF expression (26)."}

Of the known species, E. purpurea, E. angustifolia, and E. pallida are commonly used in herbal medicine. Extracts derived from the root and aerial parts are widely used in Europe and the United States as nonspecific immunostimulants and to prevent or treat the common cold and influenza. However, natural products differ greatly in composition (26), mainly due to the use of different species, variable plant materials or extraction methods, and the addition of other components. In vitro and in vivo studies suggest immunostimulatory and anti-inflammatory effects (27). A standardized echinacea preparation inactivated influenza viruses (28) and may improve respiratory activity (2) (3). In animal models, echinacea stimulated erythropoiesis, increased blood-oxygen transport (29) (30), produced anxiolytic effects (31), and exhibited wound-healing properties (32) (33) (34).\nClinical data indicate that echinacea is ineffective in preventing the common cold caused by rhinoviruses (4) or in treating upper respiratory infections (5) (6) (16). Studies of its ability to reduce incidence and duration of the common cold yielded mixed results (7) (8) (9) (10) (22) (35) (36). Other analyses do not indicate any benefits for treating colds, and weak evidence for a prophylactic benefit (26) (37), but a large randomized trial found an echinacea formulation to be as effective as oseltamivir for influenza, and with fewer adverse events in the echinacea group (38). Small studies have shown that a standardized echinacea root extract has immunomodulating activity (39); and an echinacea/sage spray was useful in treating acute sore throats (17). Preliminary data on improving or enhancing athletic performance are mixed (40) (41). But a topical echinacea extract was reported effective in alleviating symptoms associated with atopic eczema (63). Echinacea may also have anticancer potential evidenced by the cytotoxic effects exerted by an extract and a major compound, cichoric acid, in human colon cancer cells (42).\nSome studies suggest that echinacea could decrease plasma levels, affect therapeutic efficacy, or cause adverse effects with some anticancer drugs (25) (43). In HIV-infected patients, co-administration with etravirine was found to be safe and well tolerated (44). In a large population-based study, use of echinacea was associated with a slight increase in diastolic blood pressure (45). There is insufficient evidence regarding the efficacy and safety of echinacea during pregnancy (46).", "food_sources": " ", "mechanism_of_action": "Echinacea\u2019s active constituents include cichoric and caftaric acids, polysaccharides, and alkylamides (47). Immune-modulating effects of a standardized echinacea root extract include upregulation of interleukin (IL)-2 and IL-8 and downregulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha and IL-6 (39). Immunemodulation by alkylamides occurs through binding to human cannabinoid receptors 1 and 2, and by inhibiting TNF-alpha (48). Alkylamides may also be responsible for anti-inflammatory effects (27). Although echinacea does not appear to have significant ergogenic or anabolizing effects, it appears to enhance the immune system and decrease oxidative damage (49).\nIn vitro and in vivo, echinacea extracts were shown to stimulate phagocytosis, enhance mobility of leukocytes, stimulate TNF and IL-1 secretion from macrophages and lymphocytes, and improve respiratory activity (2) (3). However, their effects on innate immunity such as phagocytosis could not be confirmed, and showed only minimal effects on tumor progression, although echinacea did stimulate natural killer cell activity (50). Other studies suggest that bacterial components of echinacea are responsible for immune benefits, as total bacterial load differences and content of bacterial lipopolysaccharides within echinacea samples have correlated with NF-kappaB activation in THP-1 cells (51).\nIn human colon cancer cells, cichoric acid decreased telomerase activity and induced apoptosis via DNA fragmentation, caspase-9 activation, poly-ADP-ribose polymerase (PARP) cleavage and beta-catenin downregulation (42). Differential effects of echinacea on intestinal and hepatic CYP3A activities may be due to systemic unavailability of locally-acting constituents that inhibit CYP3A, or rapid absorption of these constituents that limits intestinal exposure and CYP3A induction, or a systemically-formed constituent metabolite that is capable of inducing hepatic but not intestinal CYP3A (52)."}

Elderberry flowers and fruit are incorporated in remedies to reduce cold and flu symptoms, for inflammation and respiratory diseases (1) (2) (3), and as a laxative (4). The berries are a rich source of anthocyanins and other phenolics and nutrients (2). Several species of Sambucus produce elderberries with similar chemical compositions including American Elder (Sambucus canadensis) and Blue Elder (Sambucus caerulea) (1), but European Elder (Sambucus nigra) is the type most studied and used in supplements.\nIn vitro studies demonstrate that elderberries possess antiviral (5), antibacterial (3), antidiabetic (6), immunomodulatory (7), antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and chemopreventive properties (1) (2) (8), although inhibition of cancer cell growth was shown to be weak (9). Flavonoids and proanthocyanidins were shown to block HIV1 infection, and may have additive effects with existing HIV drugs such as enfuvirtide (10).

Elderberry\u2019s anti-inflammatory effects may result from increased cytokine production (19) or inhibition of nuclear transcription factor kappaB and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (20). An elderberry extract improved metabolic disturbances in a murine model of obesity by lowering serum triglycerides, inflammatory markers and insulin resistance (30). Its antidiabetic properties occur via activation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma and stimulation of insulin-dependent glucose uptake (6). Elderberry may also influence HDL dysfunction associated with chronic inflammation by affecting hepatic gene expression in hyperlipidemic mice (31).

It is also one of the constituents of a popular Ayurvedic formulation, Triphala.\nThe activity of E. officinalis is often attributed to its antioxidant constituents, such as ascorbic acid, polyphenols, flavonoids, and tannins (2) (3). In vitro and in vivo studies indicate antioxidant (1) (4) (5), antibacterial (6), hepatoprotective (7) , cardioprotective (3) radioprotective (8), antiulcerogenic (9), antitumor (10), analgesic (11), antidiabetic (12) and antihyperlipidemic (13) properties.\nClinical data are limited to a few studies that show benefit in patients with uremia (accumulation of constituents in the blood that are normally eliminated in the urine) by reducing oxidative stress (5); improving HDL and lower LDL-cholesterol levels in diabetic patients (16); and lowering lipid levels and blood pressure in patients with hyperlipidemia (17).

The antidiabetic property is thought to be due to the herb\u2019s ability to reduce release of inflammatory cytokines that cause insulin resistance (12). E. officinalis may also play a role in preventing age-related hyperlipidemia by reducing nitric oxide synthase and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) protein levels via inhibiting NF-kappa B activation (13). In another study, the herb extracts were shown to induce apoptosis in mature osteoclasts, an effect that may limit bone resorption in pathologies associated with bone loss (15). And a hydroalcoholic extract of E. officinalis demonstrated anti-inflammatory effects by increasing glutathione, superoxide dismutase, and catalase activities, and subsequently decreasing lipid peroxidation (19).\nSeveral studies have also investigated the antitumor properties of E. officinalis. Pyrogallol, a component of E. officinalis extract, was found to cause cell cycle arrest in the G2/M phase, inhibit proliferation, and induce apoptosis in human lung adenocarcinoma (H441) and squamous cell cancer (H520) cell lines (2). Intraperitoneal pyrogallol injections also suppressed subcutaneous tumor growth in mice (2). An aqueous extract decreased tumor volume through inhibiting the cell cycle regulating enzyme CDC25 (10). Progallin, extracted from E. officinalis leaves, also caused cell cycle arrest in the G1/M and G2/M phase, inhibited proliferation, and induce apoptosis in human hepatocellular carcinoma cells (BEL-7404) (14). In other studies, E. officinalis extracts were shown to inhibit cell growth both in vitro and in vivo possibly via inhibition of angiogenesis and activation of autophagy in ovarian cancer cells (20); and demonstrated cardioprotective effects against doxorubicin toxicity in vitro (3), attributed to antioxidants."}

Icariin can also exhibit a mild phosphodiesterase-5 inhibition effect (16). It has been implicated in differentiation of stem cells into cardiomyocytes via cell cycle regulation, induction of apoptosis, modulation of reactive oxygen species generation, and the regulation of various signaling pathways (17). In undifferentiated neuronal cell lines, it exhibited neuroprotective effects through LDH leakage attenuation which reduced GSH depletion, prevented DNA oxidation damage, and inhibited caspase-3 and p53 activation; and inhibited JNK/p38 MAPK pathways (4). Icariin was also shown to reduce viability of  human esophageal cancer cells by regulating apoptotic signaling, which is mediated by endoplasmic reticulum stress (23).\nIcaritin, a prenylflavonoid derivative, induced sustained activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathway and apoptosis in both breast (9) and endometrial cancer cells (18).

Its radiosensitizing effects suggest ERK1/2 and AKT pathway suppression, enhanced apoptosis, and induced G2/M blockage (11). Also, icaritin may reverse doxorubicin resistance in human hepatoma cells by increasing intracellular drug accumulation, and by decreasing MDR1 and P-glycoprotein expression (12).

Evening primrose oil may improve quality of life and decrease hot flash intensity in menopausal women (44), although other data suggest that behavioral/lifestyle approaches such as exercise provide better relief (28). It has not been studied extensively for cancer, but a study involving liver cancer patients showed no effect on tumor size or survival (45). Another small study suggested that gamma-linolenic acid (GLA) may be an effective adjunctive therapy for breast cancer (4).\nAlthough evening primrose oil does not have intrinsic estrogenic properties, some commercial products combine evening primrose oil with phytoestrogens. Therefore, patients with hormone-sensitive cancers should use evening primrose oil products with caution.", "food_sources": " ", "mechanism_of_action": "Evening primrose oil is rich in omega-6 gamma-linolenic acid (GLA), which can be converted directly to the prostaglandin precursor dihomo-GLA (DGLA) (2) (3). Administration of the oil may benefit individuals unable to metabolize cis-linolenic acid to GLA, producing subsequent intermediates of metabolic significance including prostaglandins (2) (3).\nIn vitro, long-chain fatty alcohols such as hexacosanol, tetracosanol, docosanol, and octocosanol demontrate anti-inflammatory activity (29). In animal models, benefits on cardiac recovery after myocardial infarction are attributed to its hypocholesterolemic effect and indirect influence on prostaglandins and cytokine synthesis (31). In arthiritis models, evening primrose oil normalized body weight, angiopoietin-1, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha levels, and reduced malondialdehyde levels, synovial hyperplasia, and inflammatory cell invasion in joint tissues (30).\nIn patients with multiple sclerosis, evening primrose oil accelerates anti-inflammatory responses and prevents pro-inflammatory cytokine production while helping to maintain fatty acid membranes and optimizing balance between saturated and unsaturated fatty acids (40). Increases in plasma GLA and its metabolite DGLA seen with evening primrose oil supplementation has correlated with clinical improvements in atopic dermatitis (32) and produced dose-dependent effects on serum fatty acid levels and eczema severity scores (25). Inhibition of cheilitis is attributed to GLA\u2019s effects on stratum corneum maturation, differentiation, and preservation of its permeability barrier (34). Antiplatelet and anticoagulant effects are likely related to decreased thromboxane B2 synthesis induced by evening primrose oil (46) (47)."}

In addition to lower fasting and postprandial glucose levels, fenugreek-treated diabetic rats have higher hemoglobin, GSH, and plasma antioxidant levels and lower glycosylated hemoglobin, plasma lipids, and TBARS levels than diabetic controls (4). Dietary fenugreek also normalizes the activities of glucose and lipid-metabolizing enzymes in diabetic rats (3).

It may also alter estrogen metabolism, increasing the ratio of 2-hydroxyestrogen to 16 alpha-hydroxyestrone in a dose-dependent fashion (2). Flaxseed\u2019s renoprotective effects are thought to be via high concentration of alpha-linolenic acid, an omega-3 fatty acid precursor (3) or through inhibition of angiogenesis, tyrosine protein kinases, and cytokine-induced activation of transcription factors (16). The laxative effects of flaxseed are likely due to its fiber content (22).\nAnimal studies suggest growth and metastasis inhibition of established human breast cancer with flaxseed is due in part to downregulation of insulin-like growth factor I and expression of the epidermal growth factor receptor (6).

Folic acid and the L-methylfolate (5-MTHF) derivative are synthetic supplemental forms that have higher bioavailability (1). Folate is important in cell growth and division and involved in the methylation process and DNA synthesis. Inadequate intake can cause deficiency leading to megaloblastic anemia. Folate is essential during pregnancy, with supplementation shown to reduce risks of neural tube birth defects (10) and medulloblastoma in offspring (11). A study among South American populations suggests the protective effect against neural tube defects may be greater in female than male infants (65). In high doses (5 mg/day), it reduced homocysteine levels at time of delivery and may lessen pregnancy complications (43). Supplementation may also benefit women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) (42), and high folate intake reduced chromosomal aberrations in sperm of healthy men (12). But supplements taken beyond the first trimester did not prevent pre-eclampsia in women at high risk for this disorder (72).\nIn other studies, folic acid decreased homocysteine levels, a risk factor for cardiovascular disease mortality (13) (14) (15), along with lowering blood pressure in smokers (5) (16). Among hypertensive adults, folic acid therapy reduced risk of first stroke (44) (45) (66), but smoking status may affect efficacy (67). Other trials on stroke risk have yielded mixed results (17) (18) (19) (20), with a meta analysis indicating moderate to low evidence for preventive benefits of folic acid for total cardiovascular disease; and folic acid and B-vitamins for stroke (73). Folic acid supplementation has been shown to improve cognitive function in older adults (26). In patients with Alzheimer\u2019s disease, it improved response to cholinesterase inhibitors (27), cognition, and inflammatory markers (46). In individuals chronically exposed to arsenic, it lowered blood arsenic concentrations by facilitating urinary excretion (28). There is limited evidence on whether supplementation can increase serum folate levels, or has an effect on anemia in patients with sickle cell disease (68). But a combination of folic acid and vitamin B12 supplements decreased serum homocysteine levels and improved anemia in patients with multiple sclerosis (74); and folic acid added to antipsychotics may improve symptoms in schizophrenic patients (75).\nStudies on increased folate intake or supplements to reduce cancer risk are mixed. In young children, folic acid fortification was associated with reduced incidence of Wilms tumor and primitive neuroectodermal tumors (PNET) (36). Folate supplementation also helps cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN 1) regression (47). Low levels of folate in the blood are associated with certain forms of cancer (9), whereas higher levels of dietary folate have been shown to reduce the risk of breast (2) and pancreatic cancers (3), but not prostate cancer (7). Studies on colorectal cancer risk produced mixed results (4) (5) (32) (35) (48) and some even suggest a negative effect (6) (8) (49) (71). A large population study suggested an association between dietary folate intake and increased risk for overall skin cancer, basal cell carcinoma, and nonmelanoma skin cancer, particularly in women (50). Overconsumption of folic acid may also increase risk of toxicity (51) and some cancers (52). Therefore, more research is needed to examine the relationships between folate levels, supplementation, and cancer risks or prevention.\nSeveral studies that evaluated folic acid in combination with other B vitamins reported negative findings, with no overall effect on breast or invasive cancers  (33), along with the potential for increased cancer incidence and mortality in patients with ischemic heart disease  (34). Such interventions have also produced mixed results in studies for older adults with depression  (53) (54), and did not improve bone mineral density (55) or reduce fracture risk or incidence (56) (69).\nDue to its antagonistic effects, folic acid can reduce the side effects of methotrexate when used for rheumatoid arthritis (22) (23). However, it may decrease the efficacy of methotrexate in the treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (24) and psoriasis (25). Excess folate or folic acid may mask vitamin B12 deficiency  (70).", "food_sources": "Main sources include fortified breakfast cereals and breads, liver, Brussels sprouts, potatoes, spinach, chickpeas, and brewer\u2019s yeast.", "mechanism_of_action": "Folate acts as a co-enzyme during methylation. The bioactive form is tetrahydrofate, which can be converted from folic acid through the action of dihydrofolate reductase. Drugs that inhibit this enzyme can therefore reduce folic acid activity. The amino acid serine reacts with tetrahydrofolate, resulting in 5,10- methylenetetrahydrofolate, the derivative involved in nucleotide synthesis. In addition, 5-methyltetrahydrofolate transfers a methyl group to cobalamin (vitamin B12) and then to homocysteine, converting it to methionine, the precursor of methyl donor, S-adenosyl-methionine (SAMe) that plays a major role in neurological function and several biochemical pathways (41). Genetic polymorphisms that lower the production of methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) can also reduce SAMe and increase homocysteine levels. Supplementation with folic acid can therefore reduce homocysteine levels and DNA oxidative damage (57) (58). This may in turn lower risk of cardiovascular and psychiatric diseases by increasing SAMe (59) (60).

It is used for a variety of conditions, including cancer, obesity, glaucoma, asthma, and heart failure. Forskolin was shown in animal studies to promote the activation of adenylate cyclase and increase intracellular concentrations of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) (1). Small clinical studies suggest that forskolin can benefit obese men in weight management (2). Forskolin eye drops may reduce intra-ocular pressure (3) and oral forskolin capsules help reduce asthma attacks (4). When administered intravenously or inhaled, forskolin has bronchodilation effect (5) (6). Forskolin also benefits cardiovascular health due to its inotropic (7), anti-inflammatory (8) and antiplatelet properties (9). One study found intra-arterial forskolin daropate to be an effective treatment for cerebral vasospasm in patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (10). Treatment of uropathogenic E.coli-infected mice with forskolin resulted in reduced number of bacteria via cyclic AMP-regulated exocytosis (11).\nThe anticancer effects of forskolin and its derivatives have also been studied in vitro (1) (23) and in animal models (12). When applied on the skin of mice, forskolin can stimulate the production of melanin in the absence of ultraviolet light (12). It has been proposed for use in sunless tanning lotions to reduce the risk of skin cancer by decreasing exposure to sun. In an in vitro study, an extract of forskolin was found to significantly reduce viral production in human lymphoid CEM-GFP cells infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1NL4) (14).

Fucoidan also exhibited neuroprotective (11) (12), radioprotective (13), and antiulcer (14) properties.\nIn animal models, fucoidan exerts anti-inflammatory effects to protect against various organ injuries (19) (20) (21). Oral administration of fucoidan extracts also improved inflammatory pathology associated with acute colitis (22). Although a high molecular weight fucoidan did not improve outcomes in mice following intracerebral hemorrhage, it is suggested that low-molecular-weight fucoidans have increased therapeutic potential and should be evaluated for this purpose (23).\nIn humans, dietary fucoidan modulates platelet aggregation via anti-thrombotic effects (24). In overweight or obese adults, fucoidan administration over 3 months decreased diastolic blood pressure and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol concentrations, and increased insulin secretion (25). Fucoidan administration also decreased pro-viral load in a small group of patients with human T-lymphotropic virus type-1-associated neurological disease (26). The consumption of fucoisan for a 1-month period prior to seasonal influenza vaccination may boost antibody production after vaccination in immune-compromised elderly (27).\nPreclinical data suggest that fucoidan can help relieve cyclophosphamide-induced intestinal mucosal injury by altering gut flora, resulting in reduced inflammation and increased expression of tight junction proteins (30). Oral ingestion of fucoidan in a small group of volunteers was found to improve mobilization of hematopoietic progenitor stem cells with high levels of CXCR4 expression (28). In advanced stage colorectal cancer patients receiving chemotherapy, fucoidan coadministration enabled patients to continue chemotherapy and regulated fatigue (29); fucoidan also reduced the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines in another study of advanced cancer patients (31).\nBecause fucoidan demonstrates anticoagulant (8) (9) and antithrombotic (10) activities, it may have additive effects when taken with anticoagulants.", "food_sources": "Several species of brown seaweed", "mechanism_of_action": "In vitro, a low-molecular-weight fucoidan inhibited human rheumatoid arthritis fibroblast synoviocytes and triggered apoptosis via decreased expression and secretion of metalloproteinase (MMP)-1, MMP-3, and MMP-9, as well as suppression of NF-kappaB binding activity, p65 nuclear translocation, and IkappaB-alpha degradation (18). In animal models fucoidan treatment protected against liver injury via suppression of the inflammatory signaling pathway, inflammatory mediators, and inflammatory cell infiltration (20). It also reduced production of cyclooygenase-2 and nitric oxide, while increasing the expression of the hepatoprotective enzyme hemeoxygenase-1 on murine liver and HepG2 cells (21). Fucoidan suppressed inflammation in an ultraviolet B-irradiated mouse model as evidenced by decreased thickness of the prickle cell layer and decreased MMP-1 (19).\nIn humans, dietary fucoisan shortens lysis time of the thrombus by elevating prostacyclin (PGI2) secretion caused by increased H2O2 production in the blood (24). Various antitumor, antiviral and immune-modulating effects of fucoidan are attributed to the stimulation of natural killer (NK) cells, downregulation of transcription factor AP-I involved in cellular proliferation, and to the downregulation of IGF-IR signaling through the main IRS-1/PI3K/AKT pathway (2) (3) (32). In melanoma cells, fucoidan increased the antitumor effects of lapatinib via inhibition of ERBB3, known to promote melanoma metastasis (33). It was also shown to reduce tumor-promoting M2 macrophages and in combination with etoposide, to prevent HCT116 tumorigenicity in human colorectal cells (34). Neuroprotective effects are attributed to suppression of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha)- and interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma)-induced nitric oxide production in C6 glioma cells (11) and to its antioxidative effects (12). Fucoidan inhibits metastasis by preventing adhesion of tumor cells to the extracellular matrix. This is achieved by blocking the fibronectin cell-binding domain, necessary for formation of adhesion complexes (4). It also induced apoptosis of human T-cell leukemia virus type I (HTLV-1) that causes adult T-cell leukemia by inactivating NF-kB, which regulates antiapoptotic proteins (3). In a murine model, fucoidan suppressed angiogenesis induced by sarcoma 180 cells (5)."}

However, meta analyses show that there is consistent evidence to support use of garlic in lowering cardiovascular risk factors (50); and that garlic supplements have the potential to decrease blood pressure in hypertensive individuals, to regulate cholesterol levels, and have immunostimulatory effects (53). Garlic supplementation may also benefit patients with hepatopulmonary syndrome (32). More data are needed to determine if garlic is effective against common cold (33) and vaginal candidiasis (47). Whether garlic is effective in reducing the risk of mortality and cardiovascular morbidity in patients diagnosed with hypertension also remains inconclusive (45).\n\nAn analysis of several case-controlled studies in Europe suggests an inverse association between garlic consumption and risk of common cancers (9). High intake of garlic may be protective against gastric (10) and colorectal cancers (11); however, conflicting data indicate that long-term supplementation with garlic does not significantly reduce gastric cancer incidence nor mortality (43). Garlic intake was inversely associated with cancer of the prostate (12) and endometrium (13). In patients with advanced cancers, aged garlic extract (AGE) improved natural killer (NK) cell number and activity, but not quality of life (14). In patients with a history of adenomas, supplementation with AGE reduced both the number and size of subsequent colorectal adenomas (15). Garlic supplementation may also be associated with reduced risk of hematologic malignancies (40).\n\nBecause garlic is known to decrease platelet aggregation and potentially elevate International Normalized Ratio (INR) values, it should not be used with anticoagulants or in patients with platelet dysfunction (17).", "food_sources": " ", "mechanism_of_action": "The intact cells of garlic contain an odorless, sulfur-containing amino acid derivative known as alliin. When the cells are crushed, alliin comes into contact with the enzyme alliinase located in neighboring cells and is converted to allicin. Allicin is a potent antibiotic, but it is highly odoriferous and unstable. It is described as possessing antiplatelet, antibiotic, and antihyperlipidemic activities. Most authorities agree that the best measure of the total activity of garlic is its ability to produce allicin, which, in turn, results in the formation of other active constituents (1).\nIn patients with hyperlipidemia, garlic might lower cholesterol levels by acting as an HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor (21). For atherosclerosis, garlic is believed to reduce oxidative stress and low-density lipoprotein oxidation and have antithrombotic effects (22). It is also thought to reduce blood pressure by causing smooth muscle relaxation and vasodilation by activating the production of endothelium-derived relaxation factor (23).\nGarlic may stimulate both humoral and cellular immunity, causing T-cell proliferation, restoring suppressed antibody responses (24), and stimulating macrophage cytotoxicity on tumor cells. It may increase selenium absorption with possible protection against tumorigenesis (25). In addition, garlic may protect against certain cancers by halting cell cycle progression and inducing apoptosis of cancer cells as well as by decreasing angiogenesis and influencing carcinogen metabolism (26) (27)."}

Basidiomycetes polysaccharides possess antitumor, antiviral, antibacterial and immune-modulating activities. The fermentation of soy extract with basidiomycetes deglycosylates the soy isoflavones which renders them in a highly absorbable form (7).\nIn prostate cancer cells, GCP was found to inhibit mammalian target of rapamycin (MTOR) activity (4). MTOR is a downstream effector of Akt, an enzyme which plays an important role in cancer cell proliferation and survival (4).

The diet emphasizes fresh fruit and vegetable juice, high carbohydrate and potassium, no sodium or fat, and low animal protein, and is sometimes supplemented with exogenous digestive enzymes. This regimen claims to address the cause of cancer by detoxifying the system and stimulating metabolism so that the body can heal itself (10).\nCoffee enemas can cause infections, dangerous electrolyte deficiencies, and death (5). Despite proponents\u2019 claims of recovery rates as high as 70-90 percent, case reviews by the NCI and New York County Medical Society in 1947 found no evidence of anticancer effects with the Gerson diet (1).

His therapy is based on the theory that cancer is caused by alteration of cell metabolism by toxic environmental substances and food processing, which changes the sodium and potassium content of foods. Gerson\u2019s rationale is that cancer patients have low immunity and generalized tissue damage characterized by decreased intracellular potassium to sodium (K/Na) ratios, and, when their cancer is destroyed, toxic degradation products cause coma and death. His diet increases potassium intake and minimizes sodium consumption in an effort to correct the electrolyte imbalance, repair tissue, and detoxify the liver, while coffee enemas reportedly cause dilation of bile ducts and excretion of toxic breakdown products by the liver and through the colon wall. Supplemental potassium and oxidizing thyroid enzymes are given to introduce oxidation to cancer cells and kill them. None of these claims has been substantiated by scientific research (4) (6).\n\nThis regimen has resulted in coma-inducing low levels of sodium. Case reports of deaths from repeated administration of coffee enemas indicate that the practice causes a dangerous decrease in serum electrolytes. Coffee enemas have an osmolality of 62 mOsm/kg; repeated administration increases extravascular fluid volume and may cause electrolyte imbalances and subsequent death (5).\n\nThe ease of absorption of the high volumes of raw fruit and vegetables in this diet is questionable, especially in patients with GI cancers or chemotherapy-induced mucosal damage. While elements of the Gerson diet are similar to diet recommendations made by the USDA and the American Cancer Society, metabolic diets are unsuitable for some patients with disseminated or metastatic disease, particularly of the head, neck, and gut (1)."}

Another study suggests adjuvant ginger supplementation may improve CIN-related quality of life and cancer-related fatigue (58). 6-gingerol, a ginger compound, also improved overall CINV, appetite, and quality of life (59). However other studies did not show benefit with ginger adjunctive to CINV prophylaxis (60) or in patients receiving high-dose cisplatin, except for female and head and neck cancer subgroups (61).\nGinger aromatherapy was ineffective in relieving CINV, but improved quality of life (56). Another pilot study suggests that ginger supplementation may have chemopreventive effects for those at increased risk for colon cancer with normal-appearing colonic mucosa (38). More and larger studies are needed to confirm any true benefit with ginger supplementation for symptom control or chemoprevention.", "food_sources": " ", "mechanism_of_action": "The antiemetic action of ginger is attributed to the rhizome constituents shogaol and gingerol, which stimulate the flow of saliva, bile, and gastric secretions, and galanolactone, which can act as a competitive antagonist at serotonin 5-HT3 receptors (2) (22). Additional activities include the stimulation of antral contractions, reduction of postprandial antral area, and acceleration of gastric emptying (13). Ginger inhibits thromboxane formation and platelet aggregation (43). However, these effects appear to be dose- and formulation-dependent (eg, dried, fresh, or extract) (31).\nIn vitro studies suggest that fresh ginger stimulates mucosal cells to secrete IFN-\u03b2 to combat viral infection (32), while certain ginger preparations reduced lipopolysaccharide-induced secretion of IL-8 in human bronchial epithelial cells (8) and inhibited human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) and c-Myc expression in human lung cancer cells (44).\n\nGingerol induces apoptosis of gastric cancer cells through TRAIL-dependent caspase 3/7 activation (3) and inhibits cell-cycle progression by reducing cyclin D1 expression (4). It also inhibits secretion of angiogenic cytokines such as VEGF and IL-8 in ovarian cancer cells (5). In animal models, shogaol reduces in vivo tumor growth by damaging microtubules and inducing mitotic arrest (3). Increased levels of circulating antioxidant and phase II enzymes, and reduced lipid peroxidation levels are also mechanisms by which ginger protects against DMH-induced colon cancers (45)."}

It is the building block of protein and a major cellular fuel source. Although abundant in the body, patients with cancer and HIV/AIDS-related cachexia or recovering from catabolic states such as surgery, sepsis, and intense exercise may need to increase intake. Parenteral supplementations are used in hospitals but oral formulations are available in medical foods. Glutamine is also marketed as a dietary supplement to enhance muscle building, wound healing, and for intestinal and immune system health.\nGlutamine improves nitrogen balance, preserves intestinal integrity (1) (2), maintains intracellular glutamine levels, and reduces hospital stay in post-surgical or critically ill patients (3) (4), but has no effects on preventing new infections (5). Perioperative intravenous glutamine restored disturbed renal arginine synthesis that occurred from abdominal aortic surgery (6). When used in total parenteral nutrition, glutamine improved nutritional status and reduced mortality and complications (7) (8), but effects on infants with gastrointestinal disease are minimal (9) (10). Among patients with sickle cell anemia, treatment with oral l-glutamine resulted in significantly fewer pain crises (35).\nThe benefits of glutamine in cancer care have been examined in clinical studies for cachexia (11) (12) (13), peripheral neuropathy (14) (15), mucositis (16) (17) (18) (19), and gastrointestinal toxicity (20). Intravenous glutamine significantly reduced chemotherapy-induced nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea in patients with gastric or colorectal cancer (21). An RCT suggests enteral nutrition that includes arginine , glutamine, and omega-3 fatty acids may improve short-term survival in stage IV gastric cancer patients (22). It was also effective against radiation morbidity in breast cancer patients (23). Conclusions from a meta-analysis indicate glutamine reduces duration but not severity of diarrhea (24). However, conflicting data indicate that perioperative glutamine did not have an influence on post-surgical complications or infection in gastrointestinal cancer patients (25). Furthermore, recent findings suggest a role in tumor cell growth and maintenance (26) (27). More research is needed to resolve the ambiguity.\nIn an RCT of the glycemic effects of glutamine, modest decreases in concentrations of circulating blood cells, total protein, and albumin were observed (28).", "food_sources": "Wheat, corn, barley, peanuts, soybeans, egg whites, and milk", "mechanism_of_action": "Glutamine is essential for the maintenance of intestinal mucosal integrity and function (1). It maintains immune function by serving as the principle metabolic fuel for cells, acts as a precursor for protein synthesis, and along with cysteine and glycine, is involved in glutathione (GSH) synthesis. Intravenous glutamine preserves liver and intestinal glutathione stores in animal models of oxidant damage. Glutamine is also involved in nitrogen exchange, as it neutralizes and eliminates excess ammonia formed during protein catabolism. As a nitrogen donor, it contributes to the synthesis of other non-essential amino acids, including the purines and pyrimidines, and is therefore essential for the proliferation of most cells (29). It also plays a supportive role during biochemical stress and sepsis. Reduced oxidative stress and sickle cell-related pain with l-glutamine is attributed to increased proportions of the reduced form of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotides in sickle cell erythrocytes (35).\nAlthough the mechanism in treatment of cachexia is unclear, it is thought that glutamine, a modulator of protein turnover, enhances net protein synthesis (11). Clinical evidence suggests that total parenteral nutrition supplemented with glutamine improves nitrogen balance, maintains the intracellular glutamine pool, enhances protein synthesis, and prevents deterioration of gut permeability in post-surgery patients (12). \nGlutamine prevented genotoxic and clastogenic damages caused by cisplatin in mice (30). Glutamine may potentiate the tumoricidal effect of methotrexate (MTX) since polyglutamation of MTX impairs its efflux from tumor cells and may reduce its accumulation in the gut (31). The supplemental intravenous form leads to increases of GSH in the gut, but not in tumors, in a sarcoma-bearing rat model.\nHowever, recent findings show that glutamine transporters are upregulated in tumor cells and that glutamine acts as a mitochondrial substrate and promotes protein translation. This indicates tumor cell dependence for growth and maintenance (26). In addition, a recent study demonstrated that glutamine helps cancer cells survive acidic stress through enzymatic deamidation rather than provide nutrition  (27)."}

The fruits, also known as soursop, are consumed as food. The leaves and stems are used in traditional medicine for symptoms associated with inflammation and infection. Graviola is also available as a dietary supplement and widely promoted as an alternative treatment for cancer, although clinical evidence is lacking. In some Caribbean countries, it is among the most common herbal remedies used in among prostate, breast and colorectal cancer patients (33).\nMany of the health benefits from graviola are thought to be derived from its antioxidant properties (1) (2) (3) (4). In animal models, extracts from graviola leaves showed anti-inflammatory (5), analgesic (6), antidiabetic (7), antiulcer (8), and antiviral (9) effects. The leaf extracts also have antimicrobial activities (10) (11). Graviola extracts from the leaf, fruit, and seed have been tested in laboratories for their anticancer effects. Some studies show these extracts to be active against breast (16), lung (12), colon (13), prostate (14), pancreas (15), liver (17), and skin cancer (18) cell lines. However, graviola products have not been studied in cancer patients.", "food_sources": " ", "mechanism_of_action": "Annonaceous acetogenins, phytochemicals isolated from the leaves, bark, and twigs, are among the active ingredients of graviola (35). An ethanolic extract of A. muricata shows in vitro antiviral activity against the Herpes simplex virus (9), and antimicrobial activity against Leishmania  (11). Alkaloids from graviola are detrimental to the survival of dopaminergic nerve cells in vitro. This may result in neuronal dysfunction and degeneration. Graviola-induced cell death was inhibited by glucose supplementation suggesting that cell death may have been caused by energy depletion (20). Graviola has also been shown to stimulate serotonin receptors (24). An ethanolic extract produced cell-stimulating behaviors either by increased mitochondrial turnover indicating stimulation in protein production or by preparation to leave the G1 phase, perhaps due to promitotic stimulus present within the extract which acts like a growth factor (28).\nIn animal models, antidiabetic effects are due to antioxidant, hypolipidemic, and protective effects in pancreatic beta-cells, which improves glucose metabolism (7). Graviola extract demonstrated antiulcer effects by increasing nitric oxide and prostaglandin E2 activities (8). Graviola fruit extract has anti-inflammatory and analgesic actions by inhibiting cyclooxygenase (COX)-1 and COX-2 and by blocking opioid receptors (5). However, other animal studies suggest that long-term ingestion of graviola juice promotes generation of reactive nitrogen species that may accelerate development of neurodegenerative diseases involving the microtubule-associated protein tau (34).\nGraviola extracts were effective against adriamycin-resistant human mammary adenocarcinoma (MCF-7/Adr) by blocking access of cancer cells to ATP and by inhibiting the actions of plasma membrane glycoprotein (29). They also inhibited expression of HIF-1\u03b1, NF-\u03baB, glucose transporters, and glycolytic enzymes resulting in decreased glucose uptake and ATP production in pancreatic cancer cells (15), and downregulated EGFR expression in breast cancer cells (16). Phenolic compounds in graviola demonstrate free-radical scavenging potential against human breast carcinoma cells (30) and in promyelocytic leukemia cells (19). Extracts of acetogenin muricins J, K, and L have antiproliferative effects against human prostate cancer cells, with the effect of muricin K being strongest (27). In colon and in lung cancer cell lines, the ethanolic extract of graviola caused G1 cell-cycle arrest by upregulating Bax and downregulating Bcl-2 proteins (12) (13)."}

The extract is marketed as a dietary supplement to regulate blood sugar, cholesterol, blood pressure, and for weight loss and cancer prevention.

Green tea consumption may reduce the risk of hypertension (9) and cardiovascular disease (14), and a theaflavin-enriched extract lowered low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels (8). Green tea intake has also been associated with a reduction in self-reported depression (77). Some findings suggest that green tea can enhance glucose tolerance in healthy individuals (11) (12), and reduce fasting blood glucose levels (78). However, data from studies on obese (10) (60) and diabetic patients (13) are mixed.\nTopical application of green tea extracts was found effective against external genital and perianal warts (15) (16) (17). One such extract, sinecatechin, is an FDA-approved drug indicated for this use.\nGreen tea and its active compounds have been studied for their cancer preventive potential. In vitro studies suggest chemopreventive (1) and antiangiogenic (4) effects. \nPreliminary human studies suggest preventive benefits with green tea extracts among patients with oral premalignant lesions (41), or at high-risk of developing liver (61) or colorectal cancers (64). Another extract produced beneficial biologic responses in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (52).\nEGCG, applied topically, can help relieve radiation-induced dermatitis in breast cancer patients (74) (75). In addition, oral EGCG consumption was found to be effective against acute radiation-induced esophagitis in lung cancer patients (76). However, an EGCG-enriched green tea was not useful as maintenance intervention in women with advanced stage ovarian cancer after standard treatment (71), and EGCG supplementation did not reduce likelihood of prostate cancer (63).\nIn other prostate cancer studies, supplementation with a blend of green tea, pomegranate, broccoli, and curcumin had a protective effect in prostate cancer patients following post-radical treatment (59). Green tea consumption decreased PSA levels in prostate cancer patients prior to prostatectomy (72). However, higher doses of green tea catechins were associated with elevated incidence of prostate cancer in men with high grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia and/or atypical small acinar proliferation (73).\nData on whether green tea can reduce gastric and esophageal cancer risk are mixed (5) (6) (42). It was also not associated with risk of developing malignant lymphoma or multiple myeloma (65), although data suggest tea intake reduced risk of myelodysplastic syndrome (56). Other data suggest that consumption may actually increase breast cancer risk in postmenopausal women (62). Future studies are needed to resolve this ambiguity.\nThe caffeinated form may cause insomnia and nausea. Use of decaffeinated products may be preferred due to lower incidence of adverse events, but data are inconsistent regarding the relative efficacy of caffeinated versus decaffeinated teas. Animal studies indicate that oral consumption of green tea extract during fasting can increase the risk of toxicity (49). In humans, EGCG intake (200 mg, twice daily for one year) was shown to be safe (70) based on clinical data, whereas a daily dose amounting to 800 mg EGCG was associated with elevated liver enzymes, which was reversible with consumption cessation (67).

It induces nitric oxide (NO) production via activation of endothelial NO synthase, resulting in vasodilation (27). In healthy subjects, a green tea extract modulated effective brain connectivity during working memory processing (55). EGCG inhibited aggregation of tau protein, thereby reducing toxicity in neuronal model cells (57).\n\nAnticancer activities have been related to polyphenol content, with chemopreventive properties attributed to EGCG via apoptotic induction and tumor antiangiogenesis (20). EGCG may inhibit enzymes involved in cell replication and DNA synthesis by interfering with cell-to-cell adhesion or intracellular communication pathways required for cell division (21). In vitro data indicate that concentrations of 30 mcg/mL EGCG and (-)-epigallocatechin (EGC) inhibit lipoxygenase-dependent arachidonic acid metabolism by 30-75% in normal human colon mucosa and colon cancers (22). Other studies in human colon cancer cell lines suggest that EGCG inhibits topoisomerase I, but not topoisomerase II (23). It also inhibited DNA replication in leukemia cancer cell lines (24), and modulated vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) leading to apoptosis in leukemic cells (7).\nAdministration of green tea inhibits UVB light-induced carcinogenesis; when given before and during carcinogen treatment, it reduced incidence and number of stomach and esophageal tumors in mice (25)."}

In muscle cells, HMB stimulates cell growth and survival through MAPK/ERK pathways (22). HMB restored balance between intracellular protein synthesis and breakdown by activating PI3K/Akt-dependent mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) (23) (24). The stimulating effect of HMB on mTOR is eliminated with the introduction of rapamycin, an mTOR inhibitor (6) (25). However, it is unclear if HMB supplementation would also reduce the therapeutic effects of other mTOR inhibitors used in cancer treatment.

The diet involves eliminating pork, vinegar, tomatoes, pickles, carbonated drinks, alcohol, bleached flour, sugar and salt, and emphasizes iron, calcium, vitamin C, yeast supplements and grape juice. Hoxsey claims the treatment detoxifies the body, strengthens the immune system, balances body chemistry, and allows the body to digest and excrete tumors. Superoxide dismutase (SOD), vitamin B12, Gerovital (a mixture of procaine hydrochloride and vitamins), \u201cProlobin liver,\u201d TST-100, rosette cactus, Koch Antitoxins, BCG vaccine, and Shulte\u2019s medications sometimes are included in the regimen.\n\nHoxsey was convicted many times for practicing medicine without a license.

The National Cancer Institute evaluated 77 case reports submitted by Hoxsey and concluded that none showed efficacy (2).

The herbal tonic was developed by Hoxsey\u2019s great grandfather, whose horse was reportedly cured of a leg tumor after eating wild herbs. Hoxsey combined these herbs with home remedies to create the \u201cbrown\u201d tonic. In vitro and animal studies conducted with individual components (e.g., licorice, red clover, burdock, pokeroot, stillingia, barberry - see individual monographs) indicate possible anti-tumor and immunostimulant properties, but their concentrations and activity in the tonic have not been determined (1) (2)."}

Epidemiologic studies suggest that a diet high in cruciferous vegetables is associated with a lower risk of cancer and that I3C has anticarcinogenic properties across a wide range of cancers (27).\nVarious in vitro and in vivo studies suggest antimicrobial (28) (29), anti-inflammatory (30) (31) (32), anti-estrogenic (33) , and antiangiogenic (21) (22) effects. Antiproliferative and anticancer effects have been demonstrated in human breast (34) (35) (36) (37), prostate (38), melanoma (39), endometrial (40) , liver (41) (42), and pancreatic cancer cells (43), as well as animal models of lung (12) (23) (44), laryngeal (45), and nasopharyngeal carcinoma (46). In addition, preliminary experiments suggest I3C may potentiate or have sensitizing effects in combination with bortezomib (25) (47), tamoxifen (48), doxorubicin (49) (50), vemurafenib (51), fludarabine (52), gemcitabine (24) (43), or acetylsalicylic acid (53), and may reverse cytotoxicity with dexamethasone (54) or cardiotoxicity with doxorubicin (50) . However, these effects have not been confirmed in humans. Studies in animal carcinogenesis models suggest that I3C may also promote tumor growth (55) (56) (57) (58) (59) (60) (61). Additional studies are needed to determine under what conditions I3C could be a suitable chemopreventive agent in humans.\nData from early phase clinical trials suggested that I3C is effective against precancerous cervical dysplasia (2) and vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia (3). In premenopausal women, a supplement containing I3C and 7-hydroxymatairesinol, a dietary ingredient, increased the urinary 2:16-hydroxyestrone ratio, a known biomarker for the reduction of breast cancer risk (4). More recently, an RCT of a diindolylmethane formulation (DIM, an active I3C metabolite) in breast cancer patients on tamoxifen suggest it encourages beneficial changes in estrogen metabolism and circulating sex hormone-binding globulin levels (67).\nI3C is generally well tolerated when taken orally, but it is unclear if I3C supplementation can benefit humans due to its mixed effects in preliminary studies and its ability to induce cytochrome P450 enzymes (14) (62), which may cause interactions with several medications. In addition, a recent study to measure Brassica consumption in humans suggests that the chemopreventive effects derived from cruciferous vegetable consumption may plateau and not require eating large quantities or taking high-dose supplements (68).", "food_sources": "Broccoli, Brussels sprouts, cabbage, cauliflower, collards, kale, kohlrabi, mustard greens, rapeseed, rutabaga, turnips", "mechanism_of_action": "Indole-3-carbinol (I3C) is a natural indolecarbinol compound derived from the breakdown of glucobrassicin produced in cruciferous vegetables such as broccoli and Brussels sprouts (39). Some of the health-protective effects of I3C are attributed to epigenetic mechanisms such as the regulation of HDAC and HAT activities and acetylation of histones and non-histone chromatin proteins (63).\nPreliminary studies suggest several benefits to immune function. I3C counteracted immune evasion mechanisms of HPV16 by antagonizing E6 repression of E-cadherin (64). It decreased pro-inflammatory cytokine production and T cell activation by acting as histone deacetylase class I (HDAC-I) inhibitors (31). Other anti-inflammatory mechanisms include regulation of TIR-domain-containing adapter-inducing interferon-\u03b2 (TRIF)-dependent signaling pathways (30).\nIn cancer cells, I3C at higher doses (>400 \u03bcM) induced apoptosis, while lower doses (<200 \u03bcM) inihbited cell growth as well as cyclin E and CDK2 expression (27). It is among compounds that exert antiproliferative and/or proapoptotic effects through regulation of one or more microRNAs (miRNAs), short noncoding RNAs that regulate gene expression by messenger RNA (mRNA) degradation or translation repression (65).\nI3C may act as a chemopreventive agent for breast cancer through its estrogen receptor (ER) modulating effect (15) or upregulation of apoptotic enzyme activities (48). It disrupted ER alpha-mediated transcription within IGF1 cascade cell signaling components (34), downregulated expression of estrogen-responsive genes pS2 and cathepsin-D, and upregulated BRAC1 (17). Other inhibitory mechanisms include suppressing epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), blocking extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)/Sp1-mediated gene transcription, reducing matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2 and MMP-9 activities, and decreasing aromatase expression (16) (36) (37). One randomized clinical trial suggests that the decreased risk of ER-sensitive breast and cervical cancers with I3C may be due to an increase in the 2-OH-estrone:estriol metabolite ratio (18).\nIn HepG2 cells, I3C induced phase II and antioxidant enzymes (41). Other hepatoprotective mechanisms include immunomodulation and inhibition of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines (66). Acute hepatic inflammation was suppressed via decreased miR-31 expression and subsequent caspase-2-dependent apoptosis in T cells (32). In human lung carcinoma A549 cells, I3C significantly reduced cell proliferation and induced apoptosis and cell cycle arrest at the G0/G1 phase (12). In murine models, chemopreventive effects against lung tumors occurred via reductions in levels of proinflammatory and procarcinogenic proteins (44). In melanoma cells, I3C induced G1-phase cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis by stabilization of PTEN that express wild-type PTEN (39). In prostate cancer cells, I3C inhibits androgen-dependent pathways and appeared to block the inflammatory microenvironment (38), and caused apoptosis by inhibiting Akt activation (8).\nI3C coadministration with doxorubicin potentiated cytotoxic effects compared with either agent alone in pre-B acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells (49). Chemosensitive effects were produced in gemcitabine-resistant pancreatic cancer cells via microRNA-21 downregulation (43). I3C also lowered the LD50 of gemcitabine and decreased growth of pancreatic cancer cells, possibly through reactivation of the tumor suppressor gene p16INK4a (19). I3C with genistein produced synergy of apotosis and tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) in endometrial cancer cells (40). It reversed dexamethasone cytotoxicity via ROS inhibition and enhanced nuclear factor erythroid 2\u2013related factor 2 (Nrf2) expression (54).\nSome animal studies suggest that I3C is both an inhibitor and promoter of carcinogenesis with strong induction of placental glutathione S-transferase foci in the liver (57), and modulatory activity that included apoptotic inhibition in colon tumors (55). In addition, I3C may promote endometrial adenocarcinoma through hepatic CYP1 induction and estrogen metabolism modulation (56)."}

This therapy was developed in Mexico by Dr. Donato Perez Garcia in the 1930s and has been used together with other unconventional therapies for many years (1). Advocates of IPT believe that cancer cells consume more sugar than healthy cells and are therefore more sensitive to insulin and insulin-like growth factor (IGF) (2) (7). Insulin is also believed to increase the permeability of cell membranes, increasing the intracellular concentration and cytotoxic effect of anticancer drugs (1). According to the theory underlying this therapy, if cancer cells can be activated by exogenous insulin, a reduced dose (up to one-tenth the normal dose) of a chemotherapy drug can provide the same cytotoxic effects with less severe adverse reactions. No clinical trials have been performed to validate these claims. In addition, the pharmacokinetic profiles on concurrent use of insulin and chemotherapy drugs are lacking and it is unclear whether insulin also potentiates toxic effects of chemotherapy on healthy cells.\nAlthough proponents cite anecdotal case reports suggesting that IPT may be effective, there are no data comparing the efficacy of IPT to conventional chemotherapy. Most of the medications used in this therapy, such as insulin and other chemotherapy drugs, are FDA-approved but IPT clinics administer them \u201coff-label.\u201d Further, some clinics that administer IPT are not operated or staffed by oncologists.\nSide effects of IPT include hypoglycemic reaction.

It is based on the theory that insulin and insulin-like growth factor (IGF) play an important role in the cell cycle. IGF has been shown to affect proliferation, adhesion, and migration of normal as well as cancerous cells (2) and certain IGF receptors are found to be overexpressed in many forms of cancer. Therefore, cancer cells may be selectively more sensitive than normal cells to IGF (1) (7).\nIGF receptors can be activated by exogenous insulin. Insulin is also believed to increase the permeability of cell membranes, leading to the increased intracellular concentrations and cytotoxic effects of anticancer drugs.\nProponents argue that insulin synergistically enhances the efficacy of anticancer drugs so that a reduced dose can be used with similar cytotoxic effects (5) (6). However, the role of IGF receptors in cancer treatment appears to be more complex. At least one study has demonstrated that IGF receptor inhibition can also increase the effects of anticancer drugs (3)."}

Purified L-theanine is available as an oral dietary supplement. It is consumed for its perceived antioxidant and relaxant effects (12). Several in vitro and animal studies have shown that L-theanine has lipid-lowering (1), neuroprotective (2) (16), antiobesity (3), and antitumor (1) properties. It can also affect the levels of some neurotransmitters (10) (11), prevent beta-amyloid-induced cognitive dysfunction (13), and was shown to extend longevity in C. elegans (20).\nWhen combined with antipsychotic treatment, L-theanine alleviated anxiety and other related symptoms, and improved sleep in patients with schizophrenia (17) (21). In an open-label study of patients with major depressive disorder, L-theanine was safe and improved depressive symptoms, anxiety, sleep disturbance, and cognitive impairments (29).\nEpidemiological data suggest its benefits with green tea for prevention of stroke (4), but it is unclear whether L-theanine contributed to this benefit. Small studies indicate that a combination of L-theanine and caffeine improves cognitive performance (14) (15), although behavior improvements observed with caffeine alone were lost with concomitant caffeine and L-theanine supplementation (22). L-theanine may help improve sleep quality in boys with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) (18).\nTheanine derivatives are currently being studied in models of human and mouse cancers for their inhibitory effects (23).\nL-theanine enhances the chemotherapeutic effects of doxorubicin (5) and idarubicin (6), and alleviates adverse effects from use of these agents both in vitro and in animal models (7) (24). However, patients undergoing chemotherapy should discuss the use of L-theanine with their physicians because these effects are not based on clinical trials, and epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) in green tea reduces activity of the chemotherapy drug bortezomib.", "food_sources": "Green tea", "mechanism_of_action": "As a non-protein amino acid, L-theanine crosses the blood-brain barrier, exerting various neurophysiological and pharmacological effects including: anxiolytic and calming effects, due to inhibitory neurotransmitters and selective serotonin and dopamine modulation; cognitive improvements perhaps through decreased NMDA-dependent CA1 long-term potentiation (LTP) and increased NMDA-independent CA1-LTP; and improved selective attention during mental tasks likely due to changes in alpha brain wave activity (25). Neuroprotective effects are also thought to be due to its selective binding to glutamate receptors (2).\nIn animal models, L-theanine appears to have a dose-dependent biphasic effect on NSAID-induced gastric ulcers, delaying healing at higher doses (40 mg/kg), but accelerating healing at lower doses (10 mg/kg) perhaps through the maintenance of glutathione levels thus protecting against oxidative damage (26).\nIn human studies, L-theanine attenuated effects of caffeine on oxygenated hemoglobin, cognition, and mood, suggesting both independent and interactive effects between the two compounds (22). Other studies suggest that combining caffeine and theanine intake causes their individual effects to counteract each other (30) (31). L-theanine also stabilizes glutamatergic concentrations in the brain, which may explain its therapeutic effect in patients with schizophrenia (21).\nL-theanine was shown to increase the antitumor activity of chemotherapeutic drugs doxorubicin and idarubicin (5) (6). These agents normally bind the glutamate receptor and the complex is transported across the cell resulting in reduced concentrations, hence attenuating effects of these drugs. Consequent mechanistic studies revealed that L-theanine, a glutamate analogue, competes with glutamate to bind the glutamate receptor, resulting in suppression of chemotherapy efflux (extracellular transport), increasing their concentration (27).\nInterestingly, L-theanine also reduces the adverse effects of doxorubicin. The proposed mechanism is based on the variance of glutamate receptors expressed in normal and tumor cells. Whereas theanine binds the glutamate receptor in tumor cells, it is metabolized to glutamate in normal cells. This increase in glutamate likely results in increased efflux of doxorubicin from the cells, thereby decreasing toxicity (28).\nAnimal models indicate the prevention of doxorubicin-induced acute hepatotoxicity occurs through suppression of intrinsic caspase-3-dependent apoptotic signaling (24). L-theanine does not induce or inhibit cytochrome P450 enzymes (9).\nSome novel theanine derivatives were found to inhibit lung tumor growth by targeting EGFR/VEGFR-Akt/NF-kappaB pathways (23)."}

It was also reported to reduce pain and anxiety in burn patients (70), and pain from labor (71) or renal colic (72). Studies using inhaled lavender found improvements in sleep quality (36), post-acute-stress memory and physiologic function (73), dysmenorrhea and emotional symptoms (37) (38), premenstrual syndrome (75), menopause flushing (74), reduced migraine frequency (19), and agitation and falls in older individuals (20). Inhaled lavender was also shown effective in improving symptoms of dementia (5) (15) compared to dermal application (39). Aromatherapy massage with lavender affected psychological and physiological improvements in patients with acute coronary syndrome (76).\nPreclinical findings suggest anticancer effects of lavender against various cancer cell lines (47) (48) (49). Animal studies that employed the monocyclic terpene perillyl alcohol (POH), derived from several herbs including lavender, showed tumor inhibition and regression (50) (51). But clinical trials did not find effectiveness of inhaled lavender for lowering anxiety during radiotherapy (6); or for enhancing the benefits of massage with lavender oil (8).", "food_sources": " ", "mechanism_of_action": "Anti-inflammatory and analgesic effects of lavender are attributed to 1,8-cineole (2). Other major constituents include linalool and linalyl acetate, which may relax blood vessels and induce anxiolytic effects (30) (40) (54). Exposure to linalool odor has been reported to induce anxiolytic effects without motor impairment in a murine model (77).\nLavender oil also has broad-spectrum antibacterial activity (22). It reversed bacterial resistance to piperacillin in multi-drug-resistant E.coli via alterations of outer membrane permeability and bacterial quorum sensing inhibition (27); and prevented immediate-type allergic reactions by inhibiting mast cell degranulation (25). Antimicrobial activity was synergistic or additive when combined with other essential oils, with the most favorable combinations being cinnamon or sweet orange oil against C. albicans and S. aureus, respectively (28).\nIn addition, lavender has depressive effects on the central nervous system (3). In animal models, it displayed neuroprotective effects by attenuating neuronal damage, upregulating catalase (CAT), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) activities, and the glutathione (GSH)/glutathione disulfide (GSSG) ratio (21). Activity in stroke models include increased endogenous antioxidant defense, oxidative stress inhibition, and increased vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression (33). In an Alzheimer\u2019s disease model, lavender extract improved spatial performance by diminishing beta-amyloid production in the hippocampus (32). In mice with anosmia, anxiolytic effects with lavender inhalation were likely due to serotonergic mechanisms rather than olfactory activation (30) (31). However, whether lavender alleviates or exacerbates anxiety may actually be determined by genetic influences on temperament as these behaviors were amplified after exposure to lavender inhalation in calm versus nervous sheep (56). Antiepileptic effects are due to suppression of nitric oxide level in the brain (26). Cardioprotective effects against myocardial infarction are attributed to lavender\u2019s antioxidant properties (35). In wound healing models, lavender oil accelerated re-epithelialization and wound closure via enhanced epidermal growth factor (EGF) secretion (55).\nIn young women with premenstrual syndrome, lavender inhalation increased the high frequency component of heart rate variability, reflecting parasympathetic nervous system activity (37). Although lavender reduced anxiety during urodynamic assessments by increasing gamma-aminobutyric acid inhibitory effects in the amygdala, blood pressure increases were attributed to potential diuretic activity (40). A positron emission tomography study revealed anxiolytic effects may occur via reduced serotonin-1A receptor binding (41). Effects on preoperative anxiety were attributed to both the use of lavender aroma as well as the placebo effect of added attention to patients (68).\nAn aqueous lavender extract inhibited lymphocyte proliferation in Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma cell lines via apoptosis (47). In addition, lavender extracts and essential oil exhibited cytotoxicity in malignant cells, upregulated Bax expression, and induced PARP cleavage in HeLa cells, and caused a sub-G1 peak in treated cells compared with controls (48). Perillyl alcohol (POH), derived from botanicals including lavender, may affect transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta and/or Ras signaling pathways (59) and Na/K-ATPase inhibition (60). Lavender oil has weak estrogenic and antiandrogenic activities that could alter estrogen and androgen signaling pathways (14)."}

It has been used in folk medicine as a sedative (3), to reduce gastrointestinal problems (4), and for its central nervous system-depressant effects (5). It is traditionally consumed as a tea and used in aromatherapy.\nIn vitro, lemongrass exhibits antimicrobial (21) (23) (24), antibiofilm (25), anti-inflammatory (26), neuroprotective (27), vasorelaxant (10), and antidiabetic effects (28). Lemongrass extracts and constituents have shown antioxidant, antiproliferative, and apoptotic activity (8) (9) (29) (30).

In vitro, anti-inflammatory effects of lemongrass occur through inhibition of IL-1beta (26), and proteasome and nuclear factor-kappaB pathways by chlorogenic acid (47). In rat cerebellar granule neuron cultures, neuroprotective effects were attributed to antiapoptotic activity that occurred with cell cycle arrest in the G0G1 phase (27).\nIn animal models, anti-allergic and anti-inflammatory effects were attributed to the major constituents citral and geranial (33). The anti-inflammatory effects of citral were further attributed to PPAR-gamma activation (38). Lemongrass inhibits release of the inflammation marker myeloperoxidase from neutrophils and suppresses IL-6 and IL-1alpha production in mice peritoneal macrophages (13). A lemongrass hexane extract modulated allergic asthma via inhibition of nuclear factor kappa B activation (34). Analgesic effects by the constituent citronellol are attributed to inhibition of peripheral mediators as well as central inhibitory mechanisms (22). Anxiolytic activity of lemongrass appeared to be mediated by the GABAergic system (35). It also altered onset and duration of convulsions and potentiated sleep time through GABAergic mechanisms (3), and increased seizure threshold by blocking seizure propagation (15).\nIn humans, the erythropoiesis-boosting effects produced with lemongrass tea consumption are likely due to its nutritional constituents and antioxidant and pharmacologic properties  (43). As aromatherapy to revert reactive anxiety, lemongrass essential oil appears to act through the olfactory or nose-to-brain pathways to restore homeostasis (45).\nSeveral constituents in lemongrass demonstrate anticancer activity. Isointermedeol upregulates tumor necrosis factor receptor 1 leading to apoptosis through the extrinsic Fas pathway (2) (11). It also increases mitochondrial expression and activation of caspase-9 via the intrinsic cell death pathway. Citral induced apoptosis via caspase-3 enzymatic activity in human leukemia and breast cancer cells (8), and induced glutathione S-transferase (GST) through an electrophilic interaction with glutathione in rat liver epithelial cells. GST functions in cell detoxification by rescuing cells from oxidative damage and carcinogenic compounds (9) (12). Cytotoxicity was attributed to the presence of an unsaturated aldehyde group, which is specific to the geranial isomer of citral (9). Polysaccharides from lemongrass produced cytotoxic and apoptotic effects in cervical and prostate carcinoma cells via caspase 3 upregulation and Bcl-2 downregulation followed by cytochrome c release (29), and antitumor and immunomodulatory activities in sarcoma-180 tumor cells were attributed to immunoenhancement rather than direct cytotoxicity (31)."}

It is often used together with valine and isoleucine (branched-chain amino acids or BCAA), in parenteral forms for nutritional support to maintain nitrogen balance, and to treat cirrhosis and hepatic encephalopathy. Purified leucine is marketed as a dietary supplement for body building. It is thought to stimulate protein synthesis by activating the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway (1) (2). In various animal models, leucine supplementation improved leptin sensitivity (18) (19), lipid and glucose metabolism (19), exercise tolerance (20) , acquired growth hormone resistance (21), disease-related skeletal muscle dysfunctions (22), and anemia (23).\nIn clinical studies, an oral leucine-enriched BCAA mixture increased muscle protein synthesis and reversed sarcopenic processes in cirrhotic patients (24). But supplementation did not have additional effects on exercise capacity, muscle mass or quality of life when compared with supplementation plus exercise (25). Leucine was also found ineffective in improving cerebral blood flow in patients with hepatic encephalopathy (44).\nIn older adults, taking leucine with daily meals improved integrated myofibrillar protein synthesis in older men, and was equally effective in those with daily protein intake greater than or equal to the RDA (45). A leucine-rich essential amino acid mixture along with exercise significantly improved muscle mass and strength, as well as walking speed in community-dwelling sarcopenic women (26); and leucine-enriched supplements improved sarcopenia in older and older-obese adults (27) (28). In another study, combining resistance training with high-dose supplementation exerted moderate benefits on muscle strength and functional status (29). But according to a systematic review, although supplementation helps improve body weight, body mass index, and lean body mass, it does not enhance muscle strength in older sarcopenia-prone individuals (32). Additional studies have shown that leucine does not affect glycemic control in elderly diabetic men (5), although in healthy subjects and in the presence of glucose, it stimulates insulin secretion and lowered blood glucose levels (8). A review concluded that central leucine injection decreases food intake, but this effect was not reproducible with oral leucine (33).\nIn athletes, dietary supplementation with leucine may improve performance (3) and upper body strength (4). However, randomized trials in younger active populations, one involving resistance training along with powdered leucine/protein shakes (30); and another evaluating a post-surgical rehabilitation program along with supplementation among athletes (31) failed to find improvements attributable to leucine, although it appeared to promote thigh muscle recovery in the latter study (31). Studies in untrained young males reported that supplementation with resistance training does not confer any added benefits in increasing whole-body skeletal muscle mass or strength (46); and does not increase muscle strength or cross-sectional area during resistance training (47)\nPreliminary findings suggest that essential amino acids with high levels of leucine may help prevent muscle loss in patients with non small-cell lung cancer (48).", "food_sources": "Plant and animal proteins", "mechanism_of_action": "Leucine is an essential branched-chain amino acid (BCAA) associated with skeletal muscle growth and maintenance, energy production, and generation of neurotransmitter and gluconeogenic precursors (35). It stimulates protein synthesis by activating the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway (1), and is thought to enhance muscle anabolic signaling (11).\nAnimal models indicate that BCAA metabolism-related gene expression is regulated during adipocyte differentiation and influenced by nutrient levels, and leucine supplementation induces Bcat2 and Bckdha genes during early and late differentiation (35). It was shown to improve insulin sensitivity in mice that were fed a high-fat diet by decreasing adiposity, rather than through direct action on peripheral target organs (36). Supplementation also improved lipid and glucose metabolism and restored leptin sensitivity in previously obese animals (19). However, in already-obese rats, leucine worsened adiposity by encouraging hypothalamic gene expression that favored fat accumulation (37). In another study, it did not reduce food intake or induce an anorectic pattern of hypothalamic gene expression (38). Co-ingesting leucine and glycine markedly attenuated glucose response, with only a modest increase in insulin response, suggesting their effects on glucose metabolism are partially insulin-independent (39). Leucine along with sub-therapeutic levels of a PDE5 inhibitor altered lipid metabolism from storage to oxidation, improved glycemic control, and reversed hepatic steatosis induced by high-fat feeding (40).\nLeucine supplementation speeds connective tissue repair and muscle regeneration by attenuating transforming growth factor-beta type I receptor and activating Smad2/3 (41). Anti-atrophic effects were not mediated by its metabolite, beta-hydroxy-beta-methyl butyrate, and did not occur in dexamethasone-treated rats (42).\nThe ability of leucine to improve anemia in ribosomal protein-deficient cells occurs independently of TP53 (23). In Diamond-Blackfan anemia patients, leucine modulated protein synthesis by enhancing translation leading to improved hemoglobin levels (7). In the skeletal muscle of cirrhotic patients, an oral leucine-enriched BCAA mixture increased autophagy and reversed impaired mTOR1 signaling (24). Leucine may have a protective role in attenuating macrophage foam-cell formation, a hallmark of early atherogenesis, via mechanisms related to the metabolism of cholesterol, triglycerides, and energy production (49)."}

It also contains isoflavones and other constituents that have estrogen receptor-modulating activities (10). The flavone and liquiritigenin components selectively activate ER-beta (11).\nLiquiritigenin was also shown to have neuroprotective effects in scopolamine-induced mice likely via increasing expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), and phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and cAMP response element binding (CREB) in the hippocampus (55). In addition, glycyrrhizic acid, a triterpene glycoside, demonstrated anti-allerigic property by restoring the immune balance of subsets 1 and 2 of T helper cells in a dose-dependent manner. It also siginificantly reduced B cells producing allergen-specific IgE and IgG1 (56).\nLicorice demonstrated chemo-preventive effects by modulating expression of Bcl-2/Bax proteins, which act as apoptotic regulatory factors (3); and via inhibiting carcinogenesis (4). Other mechanisms include inducing apoptosis in human oral squamous cell carcinoma cells by regulation of the JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway (60); and by modulating cyclin B1-CDK1 for G2/M arrest in prostate cancer cells (61).\nThe most common side effect of licorice is hypokalemic hypertension, which occurs secondary to inhibition of 11beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase, a renal enzyme responsible for converting cortisol to cortisone. This inhibition results in enhancing the mineralocorticoid effects of cortisol (36) that include sodium retention and excretion of potassium."}

Carotenoids are classified as either provitamin A (alpha-carotene, beta-carotene, and beta-cryptoxanthin, which can be converted into retinol) or nonprovitamin A (lutein, lycopene, and zeaxanthin). Lutein has antioxidant (1) (2) and anti-inflammatory (3) activities, and supplements are marketed as protection against ocular diseases such as age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and for general eye health.\nDietary lutein may protect against DNA damage but this may be due to concomitant intake of other micronutrients (4). However, preliminary evidence suggests that supplemental lutein may reduce biomarkers for coronary vascular disease (CVD) in healthy nonsmokers (5), and increase serum lutein in patients with early atherosclerosis, thereby regulating serum lipids and reducing inflammatory cytokines (6).\nEpidemiologic studies also suggest an association between increased lutein consumption and decreased incidence of atherosclerosis (7) and cataracts (8) (9), although the effects of dietary lutein on macular degeneration are inconsistent (10) (11) (12). Other long-term studies found no effects with lutein/zeaxanthin supplementation on cognitive function (31), or risk for cataract surgery or vision loss (32) (33).\nPreliminary studies suggest lutein supplementation may increase plasma lutein concentrations and physical activity in sedentary older adults (34). It may also improve visual field in patients with retinitis pigmentosa (15). Other studies show increased macular pigment optical density (MPOD) with lutein-containing supplements in patients with Alzheimer\u2019s disease (35), but not in healthy volunteers (36) or offspring of parents with neovascular AMD (37). Although lutein/zeaxanthin improved retinal function in patients with early AMD (38), the current evidence is insufficient to support its use  (12) (13) (14).\nIncreased lutein consumption may decrease the risk of renal cell carcinoma (16), nonaggressive urothelial cell carcinoma (17), and breast cancer (18). Data on the effects of dietary lutein intake and risk of cervical or colon cancer are conflicting (19) (20) (21) (22), whereas no association was found between lutein and lung cancer risk (23) or prostate cancer risk (39).", "food_sources": "Kale, spinach, winter squash, cruciferous vegetables, cabbage, green beans, yellow/orange fruits, mangoes, papayas, peaches, oranges (1). Lutein is absorbed best with meals that are higher in fat.", "mechanism_of_action": "Lutein is one of the predominant carotenoids that accumulates in both the lens and retinal macula (24). It scavenges reactive oxygen species, preventing damage to DNA and protein molecules (19) (25). As an oxycarotenoid, its structure is less hydrophobic than beta-carotene and lycopene. This enables lutein to react with free radicals in a membrane\u2019s aqueous phase, resulting in increased membrane integrity, which may in turn affect tissue permeability to oxygen and other molecules (19). It may also protect against ocular damage by reducing the amount of blue light that reaches photoreceptors (25).\nAs a nonprovitamin A carotenoid, lutein does not have any vitamin A activity, but does have antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and immune-enhancing properties. In an obese rat model, lutein independently reduced superoxide dismutase activity, and also raised glutathione peroxidase activity in lean rats when combined with ascorbic acid (26). In vitro and atherosclerotic mouse models demonstrate the ability of lutein to inhibit monocyte inflammatory responses to low-density lipoprotein (LDL) in the artery wall and reduce monocyte migration (7). In humans, lutein supplementation decreases lipid peroxidation and inflammatory response (5).\nCarotenoids including lutein inhibit mutagenesis and transformation, and premalignant lesions (1). In murine mammary cancer models, dietary lutein selectively modulated apoptosis and inhibited angiogenesis by increasing p53 and Bax proapoptotic gene expression, while decreasing Bcl-2 antiapoptotic gene expression with a subsequent increase in Bax:Bcl-2 ratio in tumors (27). Lutein-mediated AP-1 suppression and anti-inflammatory effects are due to its antioxidative and p38/c-Jun-N-terminal kinase inhibitory activities (3). In a hepatocellular carcinoma animal model, lutein reduced \u03b3-glutamyl transpeptidase activity, a marker of cellular proliferation (2)."}

Epidemiologic studies suggest an inverse relationship between lycopene consumption and risk of cancer (3), particularly lung (4), stomach (5), prostate (6), and hormone-positive breast cancers (7). A consistent association between lycopene consumption and endometrial cancer risk has yet to be reported (8) (9).\nClinical data on lycopene supplementation for prostate cancer prevention remain inconclusive. Whereas low intake of tomato sauce was associated with advanced prostate cancer in patients with low-grade cancer at diagnosis (10), other studies indicate that lycopene or tomato-based regimens do not prevent prostate cancer (11) (23) (31). In men with high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN), a lycopene-rich extract did not confer any benefits (32); and high doses of lycopene, green tea catechins, and selenium were actually associated with higher prostate cancer incidence (28). Also, variable results were reported for lycopene supplementation in prostate cancer patients (12). One study suggests that increasing lycopene intake may alter the serum metabolome of men at risk of prostate cancer (33). Given these mixed results, more studies are needed to determine whether lycopene has protective effects in prostate cancer.\n\nQuality control of lycopene supplements is also a concern.

In human liver adenocarcinoma cells, antimetastatic activity was attributed to downregulation of NADPH oxidase 4 (NOX4), which produces reactive oxygen species (30).\nOther possible mechanisms for all carotenoids include immune enhancement as well as inhibition of mutagenesis and transformation, and premalignant lesions.

A methanol maca extract demonstrated antiviral activity against Flu-A and Flu-B viruses (17). An isolated N\u2011alkylamide from maca root was found to possess both direct and indirect cannabimimetic actions (32). Maca polysaccharides demonstrated radical scavenging activity (18). Macamides, normally not present in fresh plants but introduced during traditional drying practices (31), are fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH) inhibitors, and act on the central nervous system by modulating the release of neurotransmitters (19). Antidepressant-like effects were associated with activation of both noradrenergic and dopaminergic systems and attenuation of oxidative stress (20).\nIn animal models, maca powder derived from tubers enhanced serum luteinizing hormone (LH) levels in female rats during the proestrus LH surge in a dose-dependent manner, suggesting it may enhance fertility (33). In postmenopausal models, maca modulates hormone levels particularly by decreasing follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) levels (21).\nIn humans, although maca does not affect serum levels of LH, FSH, prolactin, testosterone, or estradiol in men (4) (9), it appears to modulate some hormone levels in women in some studies (24) (26) but not others (25) (27). Increased LH and decreased FSH that corresponded with improved sexual functioning in postmenopausal women are potentially attributed to a negative feedback loop, resulting in increased androgen production (24) (26). It may also exert androgenic effects at the testosterone receptor on target organs without affecting testosterone or gonadotrophin levels (24) (30). At the same time, the benefits of maca for antidepressant-induced sexual dysfunction in women may be more a function of advancing age rather than menopausal status, as there was no correlation with estrogen levels (24)."}

"Magnesium sulfate (Epsom salts)"], "scientific_name": " ", "warnings": " ", "clinical_summary": "Magnesium is an essential mineral involved in numerous biochemical processes, including adenosine triphosphate (ATP) production, cellular signal transduction, DNA, RNA and protein synthesis, and bone formation (1) (2). It also helps regulate blood pressure and enzymes such as those that control intracellular calcium and potassium, and is essential for normal heart functioning (1) (3). The dietary form can be found in many foods, and especially in dark green leafy vegetables, nuts, legumes, whole grains, fruits, and fish (4).\nIn dietary supplements, other over-the-counter products, and pharmaceutical preparations, magnesium is combined with another substance such as a salt or acid, and has specific therapeutic uses. The carbonate, hydroxide, and oxide forms are found in antacid and laxative products whereas citrate is used as a laxative before diagnostic procedures or surgery of the colon. The chloride, gluconate, lactate, and sulfate forms are clinically used to treat magnesium deficiency.\nBoth dietary and supplemental forms have been studied widely for their potential role in chronic ailments such as heart disease and diabetes. Dietary intake is associated with reduced mortality from cardiovascular disease, especially for women (5). It is also associated with reduced risk of sudden cardiac death (SCD), although studies have been mixed and more affirmative for the effect of serum magnesium on SCD (6) (7). It may help reduce the risk of ischemic stroke (8), metabolic syndrome (9) (10), type 2 diabetes (11) and insulin resistance (12), asthma (13), and osteoporosis (1), but findings from studies on depression are conflicting (14) (15). Other studies also have not linked dietary consumption with cancer incidence and mortality (16), or pancreatic cancer risk (17), but have associated higher intake with a lower risk for colorectal tumors (18) and lung cancer (19). Additional studies are needed to confirm these effects.\nMagnesium supplementation has been evaluated for a variety of health conditions. Oral intake may increase survival in patients with heart failure (20) (21), and improve insulin sensitivity in healthy adults (22) (77), and in those with diabetes (77). In a study of overweight individuals, supplementation resulted in changes in gene expression and other positive effects on metabolic pathways (23). Some studies have shown a reduction in blood pressure following supplementation (24) (25), but an earlier systematic review suggests the positive findings are due to poor trial design and short duration (26). Also in contrast, data from a large, community-based cohort did not show low serum levels to be a risk factor for developing hypertension or cardiovascular disease (27).\nOther studies of oral supplements have demonstrated positive effects on bone mass accrual in healthy adolescents with inadequate intake (28), and suppressed bone turnover in postmenopausal osteoporotic women (29). In adults with asthma, supplementation improved objective measures of airway resistance and subjective measures of asthma control and quality of life (13); in pediatric patients with cystic fibrosis, it has improved respiratory muscle strength (30). There is also moderate evidence for its use in migraine headache and prophylaxis (31). Although preliminary data have shown mixed results with oral supplementation for premenstrual syndrome (32), a pilot study indicates that it reduces menopausal hot flashes in breast cancer patients (33), and a systematic review supports its use for leg cramps during pregnancy (34). Larger studies are needed to elucidate conflicting results and clarify the roles for supplementation across various health conditions.\nMany adults, particularly African-Americans (35) and the elderly (9), may not have adequate dietary intakes of magnesium. However, true deficiency most often occurs with critical illness including cardiac conditions and preeclampsia, as well as gastrointestinal and renal conditions, poorly-controlled diabetes, and alcoholism (3). In addition, certain medications including calcineurin inhibitors (36), high-dose antivirals (37), and the long-term use of proton pump inhibitors (38), as well as some cancer therapy regimens (39) (40) and surgical procedures (41) (42), may also cause hypomagnesemia. If deficiency is suspected, patients should be evaluated by their treating physician to determine the extent of inadequate intake and its effective management, as well as to avoid potential drug interactions or magnesium toxicity.\nHypermagnesemia is rare and results from failure to excrete magnesium or because of excessive intake. It may especially occur in patients with gastrointestinal or renal dysfunction, and have serious effects such as hypotension, bradycardia, depression of tendon reflexes, and other cardiovascular and neuromuscular manifestations (43) (44).", "food_sources": "Leafy vegetables, nuts, legumes, whole grains, fruits and fish (4)", "mechanism_of_action": "Magnesium plays a significant role in vascular and metabolic biology as well as numerous biochemical reactions. It negatively regulates vascular calcification and osteogenic differentiation through an increase or restoration of transient receptor potential melastatin 7 (TRPM7) activity and increased expression of anticalcification proteins, in vitro (45). It also influences blood pressure levels through interactions with the renin-angiotensin system, by acting as a calcium channel blocker to reduce vascular resistance, and by modulating vascular tone and reactivity (46) (47). Further, it contributes to the homeostasis of electrolytes in cells via sodium-potassium pump activation (47) and can revert impaired intracellular ion homeostasis (25).\nAs a cofactor of all reactions involving ATP transfer, magnesium is a major determinant of insulin and glucose metabolism, critical to carbohydrate metabolism, and regulates the activity of all enzymes involved in phosphorylation reactions (48). These vascular and metabolic mechanisms are echoed by observed relationships between deficiency and oxidative stress, proinflammatory states, endothelial dysfunction, platelet aggregation, insulin resistance, and hyperglycemia (48) (49). A possible mechanism of cardiovascular benefits may be via a reduction in arterial stiffness (76).\nMagnesium can also serve an immunomodulatory function by regulating NF-kB activation and cytokine production, and limiting systemic inflammation (50). It also reduces markers for systemic inflammation and endothelial dysfunction including C-reactive protein (4) (51). Its salts are poorly absorbed, and act as an osmotic laxative by retaining water in the intestine. The mechanism by which it may affect the bioavailability of concomitantly administered drugs is through the formation of insoluble chelate complexes with those drugs, substantially reducing their bioavailability (52).\nExperimental and epidemiological evidence for the role of magnesium in cancer is conflicting. Its part in cellular metabolism and maintaining genetic stability, regulation of cell proliferation, and protection against insulin resistance, oxidative stress, and systemic inflammation are also cancer-preventive attributes (18) (19). At the same time, hypomagnesemia as a side effect of some cancer treatments may produce an inhibitory effect on tumor growth and neo-angiogenesis, but magnesium levels are also increased in tumors both in vivo and in vitro, suggesting its multiple and possibly dichotomous roles in cancer (53) (54)."}

Magnetic fields are administered by application of magnets to certain parts of the body, by magnetic field-generating machines, or with magnetic mattresses or blankets. Treatment can last minutes to weeks. Evidence supporting the use of magnetic therapies for the above conditions are limited. State consumer protection agencies and the FDA have prosecuted various marketers of magnetized devices and therapies, forcing them to halt unsubstantiated claims of health benefits.\n\nIn vitro studies show that static magnetic fields may modulate ion transport and related cell and neuronal activity (4) (7), but the physiological significance of these findings is unknown. No anticancer activity has been demonstrated. Patients also use magnetized braces and mattresses to treat pain associated with fibromyalgia, diabetic neuropathy, sciatica, and arthritis. Clinical studies of these devices are small and flawed.

It is purported that the positive (south) pole of the magnet has a \u201cstress effect,\u201d which interferes with metabolic functioning, produces acidity, reduces cellular oxygen supply, and encourages the replication of latent microorganisms. The negative (north) pole is said to have a \u201ccalming effect\u201d and helps to normalize metabolic functioning, promote oxygenation, and treat neurological/psychiatric disorders. No evidence supports these claims, and no anticancer activity is seen for magnetic fields in laboratory or human studies. Most anecdotes of magnetic \u201chealing\u201d involve symptoms that may be psychosomatic, associated with stress, or subjective measures such as pain or depression (3).\n\nTheoretically, static magnetic fields (SMFs) may alter ion flow, cellular potential, membrane configuration, ion pump activity, or neurotransmitter release (4). Most of the biological phenomena associated with SMFs may be caused by changes in cellular calcium (8). SMFs of 1,000-4,000 G are found to alter protein and enzyme structure and the kinetics of reactions involving free radicals (7) (9). Reduced action potential firing in cultured neurons and permeability changes in synthetic liposome vesicles are observed after application of a SMF (5). It may not be legitimate to extrapolate in vitro data in which cells are directly exposed to magnetic fields, to their effect in a complex biological system. Moreover, many in vitro studies have not been replicated. Although some authors refer to documented effects of pulsed electromagnetic fields in attempting to explain a mechanism of action for static magnets, SMFs do not generate an electric field and therefore cannot confer the claimed physiologic effects (10). It is suggested that positive reports of magnet use reflect placebo effects."}

Other anti-inflammatory markers reduced by magnolia bark extract include IL-6 as well as matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP2) and MMP9 (4) . Antihyperglycemic effects with magnolia bark extract are attributed to the inhibition of protein tyrosine phosphatase enzyme 1B, a negative regulator of the insulin signaling pathway, which increases ERK phosphorylation and GLUt4 translocation (5). Magnolol increased both insulin-stimulated glucose transport and production of GLUT1 and GLUT4 mRNA, and GLUT4 protein (6).\nA combination of honokiol and magnolol normalized biochemical abnormalities in brain 5-HT and 5-HIAA, serum corticosterone levels, and platelet adenylyl cyclase activity, a biomarker for depression in chronically stressed rodents (7). Anxiolytic effects of honokiol are attributed to its selective stimulation of GABA-A receptors or its binding to anxiety-related sites (8).\nA number of anticancer mechanisms have been identified with magnolol. In human bladder cancer cells, it induced p27KIP1-mediated G2/M-phase cell cycle arrest to activate the extracellular signal-regulated kinase pathway (11), and decreased the binding of transcription factor NF-kappaB to DNA to inhibit MMP9 expression (12). In prostate cancer cells, magnolol affected the expression of insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) and associated binding proteins (13), inhibited the EGFR/PI3K/Akt signaling pathway (16), and downregulated MMP2 and MMP9 protein and mRNA levels (15). Antitumor activity also occurred via MMP9 inhibition through the NF-kappaB pathway in breast cancer cells (19) and through AMPK activation in colorectal cancer cells (18).\nAntitumor and antiangiogenic properties of honokiol are attributed to nuclear factor kappa beta (NF-kB) inhibition and the consequent scavenging of reactive oxygen species (24). In human endothelial cells, honokiol inhibited vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR2) phosphorylation (25). It also blocked VEGF-induced Rac to prevent migration of malignant endothelial cells (25), blocked signaling pathways in tumor cells with defective p53 (23), and suppressed NF-kB overactivity (24). In acute myeloid leukemia cells, honokiol inhibited STAT3 signaling via increased protein tyrosine phosphatase SHP1 expression (26). In glioma cells, it induced autophagy and activated a p53/cyclin D1/CDK6/CDK4/E2F1-dependent pathway to induce apoptosis and cell cycle arrest (34) and in prostate cancer cells, honokiol suppressed c-Myc protein expression (30).\nIn animal models of prostate cancer with bone metastasis, honokiol induced apoptosis via caspase-3,-8, and -9 activation and poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) cleavage (37).

Alpha- and gamma-mangostins act as histamine and serotonin receptor blockers (8) and inhibit HIV-1 protease (9). In animal models, they reduced major features of allergic asthma including airway inflammatory cell recruitment and hyperresponsiveness, increased Th2 cytokine levels, and attenuated increases in phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) activity, phosphorylation of Akt, and NF-kappaB (26). The ability of alpha-mangostin to inhibit fatty acid synthase may occur via stronger action on the ketoacyl synthase domain and weaker effects on the acetyl/malonyl transferase domain (22). It also reduced prostaglandin synthesis by inhibiting COX-1 and -2 enzyme activities (5), and prevented oxidative damage of LDL by functioning as a free-radical scavenger (7). The compound isogarcinol isolated from mangosteen induces anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressant effects in animal models (30) (31). Mangosteen extract may have antiobesity effects by increasing AMP-activated protein kinase and Sirtuin 1 activities in the liver (42).\nChemopreventive properties of mangosteen xanthones against specific human cancer cell lines have also been demonstrated, including: alpha-mangostin in leukemia (1) (6) (32), breast (33) (34), gastric (35), and pancreatic cancer cells (36) (37); gartanin in urinary bladder cancer (38); and gamma-mangostin (39) and garcinone E (10) in liver cancer cells. Extracts from the pericarp of mangosteen also exhibit antioxidant (13), antiproliferative, and apoptotic effects (11).\nThe preventive effect of alpha-mangostin on cisplatin-induced apoptotic death is associated with the inhibition of p53 expression and generation of reactive oxygen species (23). Alpha-mangostin inhibited growth of leukemia HL60 cells by inducing caspase-3-dependent apoptosis (1) (6). It reduced matrix metalloproteinase MMP-2 and -9 expression, increased E-cadherin expression, and suppressed the ERK signaling pathway in pancreatic cancer cell lines (36). In chronic myeloid leukemia cells, it induced autophagy via increased expression of the autophagosome marker LC-3II and accumulation of autophagic vacuoles, in addition to antiproliferative and apoptotic effects (32). Another study also attributes the antitumor activity of alpha-mangostin to autophagy and not endoplasmic reticulum stress induction (24).\nBeta-mangostin decreased the proliferation of human cervical cancer HeLa cell by inhibiting cellular polymerases (43).\nGamma-Mangostin demonstrated free radical scavenging activity in human liver cancer cells (39).\nIn bladder cancer cell lines, activities of gartanin suggest mTOR pathway inhibition, downregulation of Bcl-2 expression, and p53 pathway activation leading to apoptotic induction (38)."}

Epidemiological studies show that it contributes to better health and overall quality of life. It is also an established model of eating for primary and secondary prevention of various chronic diseases. The Mediterranean diet consists of a variety of fruits, vegetables, cereals, legumes, poultry, fish, nuts, seeds, olive oil, and moderate intake of red wine with meals (1). Olive oil, a monounsaturated fatty acid (MUFA), comprises 15% to 20% as the major source of dietary fats in this diet (2). Another hallmark is the low consumption of meat and dairy products (3).\nEpidemiological analyses suggest that over 90% of type 2 diabetes, 80% of coronary heart disease, and 70% of stroke can be avoided by adopting healthful food choices that model the traditional Mediterranean diet (4).\nAlthough there were no significant associations with reduced bladder cancer risk (11), other large prospective studies found that adherence to the Mediterranean diet resulted in significant reductions for hip fracture incidence (12), risk of sudden cardiac death (13), gastric adenocarcinoma incidence (6) , modest reductions in colorectal cancer risk (14), and overall reduction in cancer risk (7). A randomized controlled trial demonstrated that a Mediterranean diet can reduce the risk of cardiovascular  events (10). Conclusions of various meta-analyses also indicate associations between greater adherence to the Mediterranean diet and significant reductions in weight gain (15) (16) as well as risk factors for diabetes and cardiovascular diseases (8) (9) (15), overall mortality, cancer incidence and mortality, and incidence of Alzheimer\u2019s and Parkinson\u2019s disease (1). Results from PREDIMED, the largest long-term randomized trial in Spain examining disease and mortality outcomes with the Mediterranean diet, also confirm these findings (17) (18) (19) (20) (21) (22). Moreover, secondary analyses of PREDIMED suggests that a Mediterranean diet supplemented with extra-virgin olive oil confers benefits in the prevention of breast cancer (29), and improves atheroprotective functioning of high-density lipoproteins for individuals at high risk for cardiovascular disease (30). Other studies suggest it can reduce systolic blood pressure, improve endothelial functioning (31), and protect against macular degeneration (32).\nInterestingly, a large cross-sectional study identified certain factors that improved adherence to the Mediterranean diet, including female sex, older age, higher levels of physical activity, and moderate alcohol consumption, while poorer adherence was associated with males and obesity (23).

Greater polyphenol intake from lignans, flavonols, and hydroxybenzoic acids found in the Mediterranean diet may be associated with decreased cardiovascular disease risks (26).

A meta-analysis did not find any significant effects with melatonin on secondary sleep disorders associated with medical, neurological, or substance abuse disorders (5), but supplementation was reported to improve subjective sleep quality in patients with traumatic brain injury (44). Additional studies show that melatonin may decrease surgery-associated anxiety and pain (6) as well as frequency of migraine attacks (7). Systematic reviews indicate that it can reduce perioperative anxiety (30), but there is insufficient evidence for its use to improve sleep in ICU patients (46), depression or depressive symptoms (47), or for seasonal affective disorder (SAD) (48). It also did not improve nocturia in a small study of multiple sclerosis patients (53). A few studies suggest melatonin may be helpful for jet lag (51) (52). Studies on whether melatonin can help in benzodiazepine withdrawal are mixed (49) (50).\nIn vitro and in vivo studies suggest that melatonin has antioxidant (38) (39) and antiproliferative properties, including against breast cancer cells (40); synergistic effects with anticancer agents (8) (9) (32); and protective effects against adriamycin-induced cardiotoxicity (33).\nClinical trials evaluating melatonin as a monotherapy or in combination with other agents and in patients with solid tumors suggest improvements in quality of life and survival time (10) (11) (12) (13), but melatonin did not improve appetite, weight, or quality of life in cancer patients with cachexia (35). In studies of postmenopausal breast cancer survivors, short-term supplementation did not influence estradiol levels (36) but improved sleep quality (37). A meta-analyses suggests melatonin may help reduce incidence of some chemotherapy side effects including thrombocytopenia, asthenia, and neurotoxicity (54).

Nocturnal secretion is regulated by circadian rhythms and nighttime darkness (17), and melatonin is thought to control the circadian pacemaker and promote sleep. Ironically, it is associated with wakefulness and activity in nocturnal animals (14). As levels of melatonin increase, an associated drop in core body temperature occurs. Both elderly and depressed patients tend to have lower basal levels of melatonin (2).\nMelatonin is a free-radical scavenger (18) (38) and enhances antioxidative enzyme activities (39), interacting with cytosolic calmodulin and stimulating IL-4 production in bone marrow T-lymphocytes (1). In vitro and animal studies suggest that antitumor effects may occur through antimitotic or immunomodulatory activity. In vitro studies demonstrate antiproliferative effects on human breast cancer (HS578T) (19) and mouse melanoma (B16BL6, PG19) (8). Decreases in breast cancer metastasis may occur via modulation of Rho-associated kinase protein-1 expression (41). Melatonin reduces proliferation of PC-3 and LNCaP cells in mice, but has no effect on apoptosis (9). Its effect on tumor cell growth may be mediated in part by melatonin receptor signaling (20) (21). In endometrial cancer cells, it interferes with estrogen receptor expression (22). Other laboratory studies suggest that melatonin behaves both as a selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM) and as an aromatase inhibitor (42) (43). In a murine model, it modulated expression of genes crucial for DNA repair \u2014 Ogg1, Apex1, and Xrcc1 \u2014 in peripheral blood cells, to reduce X-ray-induced DNA damage  (45)."}

Kahweol and cafestol are constituents of green coffee that stimulate GST activation, but their activity is destroyed with roasting. Repeated administration of coffee enemas increases extravascular fluid volume and can cause serum electrolyte imbalances. Significant loss of bile salts associated with repeated long-term administration of enemas can result in malabsorption of fat, fat-soluble vitamins, and calcium (2) (3) (4)."}

Mistletoe extracts are used for a variety of conditions including cancer, HIV, hepatitis, and degenerative joint disease. Oral preparations are available as dietary supplements and homeopathic remedies. However, most clinical research has evaluated mainly parenteral formulations, which are not approved for use in the United States by the Food and Drug Administration.\nStudies support the use of mistletoe to improve symptoms and quality of life, and reduce chemotherapy and radiotherapy side effects, including in pancreatic (13) (37), lung (11), colorectal (12), and breast (14) cancers. Some studies suggest it may help prolong survival (6) (8) (9) (13), but other study results are mixed (17) (18) (19) (43). Preliminary studies suggest that intravesical mistletoe extract is safe and well tolerated in patients with nonmuscle invasive bladder cancer (38), and that mistletoe extract injection may be efficacious for chemical pleurodesis in patients with malignant pleural effusion (39) (44).\nIn two studies with 5-year follow-ups of breast cancer patients, mistletoe did not appear to negatively influence chemotherapy efficacy (14) and appeared to continue reductions in persistent symptoms (15). In patients with advanced solid tumors, the addition of mistletoe administration allowed for higher gemcitabine doses to be used without apparent pharmacokinetic interactions (16). Concomitant mistletoe appeared to reduce adverse events from monoclonal antibody therapy (45) but not immune checkpoint inhibitors (46). Benefits with mistletoe treatment in combination with medical care have also been reported (47) (48). Large prospective studies are needed to determine safety and whether these immune-related events translate to beneficial outcomes.\nRaw mistletoe contains toxic constituents. Possible adverse effects from mistletoe treatment include injection site reactions, chills, and fever (16) (20) (39) (40) (41). Long-term use may also reduce T-cell function in cancer patients (21), but the majority of reactions were mild to moderate and dose-related (22) (49).\nMistletoe inhibits CYP3A4 in vitro, so it could theoretically interact with drugs metabolized by this enzyme.

In vitro studies show that lectins induce macrophage cytotoxicity, stimulate immune-cell phagocytosis, increase TNF\u03b1, IL-1, IL-2, and IL-6 cytokine secretion, and enhance cytotoxicity (29). In lymphoblastic leukemia cells, mistletoe extracts stimulate dendritic cell maturation and activation (30) and induce dose-dependent apoptosis through caspase-8 and -9 dependent pathways (26).\nIn animal models, triterpene-containing mistletoe extracts produced the greatest apoptotic induction (26) and improved efficacy against malignant melanoma compared with conventional extracts via reduced tumor angiogenesis (31). Viscotoxins may also be responsible for tumor-inhibiting and immune-stimulating activities (28). However, mistletoe produced both pro- and anti-proliferative effects depending on dose (32).\nMistletoe preparations induce T-helper 2 immune response, as evidenced by significant eosinophilia during treatment in patients with chronic hepatitis C (2). Mistletoe-induced immune stimulation may explain physical improvements that contribute to increased quality of life in cancer patients (5)."}

In addition, phenolic glycosides from the fruit show anti-inflammatory effects by inhibiting nitric oxide (13). Dipeptide and urea derivatives from MO roots also have anti-inflammatory and antinociceptive effects and may benefit those with arthritis (14). The ethanolic seed extract may produce immunosuppressive and anti-inflammatory effects by inhibiting leukocytes and splenocytes (15) as well as histamine release from mast cells (16). It also reduced airway inflammation suggesting it may benefit those with asthma (17). Phenolic components may be responsible for its antisickling activities (37). In an animal model, MO root extract demonstrated protective effects on the liver and kidney in a dose-dependent manner (22). It reduced urinary oxalates and may help prevent urolithiasis (23). MO extract may protect against stomach ulcers by modulating 5-HT3 receptors (24) and lower cholesterol by inhibiting HMG-CoA reductase (25).\nA water extract of MO showed hormone-modulating properties, stimulated uterine and cervical epithelium metaplasia (26) (27), and exhibited antifertility effects (28).

Nattokinase is also available as a supplement and is most known for its fibrinolytic and thrombolytic effects.\nA few studies have explored its antihypertensive and amyloid-plaque degrading abilities (1) (2) (3) (4) (5). Nattokinase decreases platelet aggregation and thrombus formation in a dose-dependent fashion both in vitro and in vivo (6) (7). Reduced intimal thickening was observed in the femoral artery of rats that were fed a diet containing natt\u014d (8).\nIn a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled human trial, nattokinase capsules reduced diastolic and systolic blood pressure in pre-hypertensive patients (3). The observation that nattokinase degrades amyloid plaques (1) (9) led to an interest in exploring it as a treatment for Alzheimer\u2019s disease, which is characterized by accumulation of amyloid plaques.\nNattokinase has also been promoted as an alternative anticancer treatment based on the notion that it can help dissolve the fibrin coating around a tumor, and increase oxygen supply in the blood to inhibit cancer cell growth. However, these mechanisms have not been proven in humans.\nTheoretically, nattokinase may increase bleeding risk when used with anticoagulant, antiplatelet, and fibrinolytic drugs.

PAI is a key inhibitor of tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) that converts plasminogen to plasmin. PAI inactivation allows for greater tPA activity and increased lysis of clots (10) (11). In the absence of PAI, nattokinase affects direct proteolysis of fibrin; however, this effect is less than the protelysis achieved by the PAI-mediated pathway (2). The fibrinolytic activity of nattokinase is estimated to be four fold that of plasmin (12).\nNattokinase is currently being evaluated for its potential as an amyloid plaque-degrading agent. Low doses of nattokinase have been shown to increase expression of the ADAM10 gene, which belongs to a family of proteinases that degrade the amyloid precursor protein (APP). The upregulation of ADAM10 may shift the amyloidogenic pathway to the non-amyloidogenic pathway. This activity may be used as a method to prevent amyloid plaque accumulation that characterizes Alzheimer\u2019s disease (9)."}

Anti-inflammatory activity in noni extract was attributed to quercetin (34). In addition, noni juice exhibited antioxidant effects by reducing aromatic DNA adducts (5) (19).\nIn animal models, an aqueous extract of noni root produced a central analgesic effect that was antagonized by naloxone (6). Hepatoprotective effects occur through regulation of lipid homeostasis, antioxidant status, and anti-inflammatory responses (36) (37). The primary iridoid deacetylasperulosidic acid may exert antioxidant effects by increasing superoxide dismutase activity (42). Scopoletin and rutin in noni may be responsible for antidopaminergic and antiadrenergic effects (46). Scopoletin also stimulates gastrointestinal motility by acting as a 5-HT4 receptor agonist (38). Treatment with noni extract prevented memory impairment through increased brain energy metabolism, cholinergic neurotransmission, brain-derived neurotrophic factor, and antioxidative activity (40).\nWhen combined with suboptimal doses of certain chemotherapy agents, polysaccharides from noni improved survival time and curative effects (4). Apoptotic effects occur via upregulation of p53 and proapoptotic Bax proteins, as well as downregulation of the antiapoptotic Bcl-2, Bcl-XL proteins and survivin. Increase in caspase 9 and 3 was also reported, which suggests involvement of the intrinsic mitochondrial pathway (31). In cervical cancer cell lines, malondialdehyde levels were significantly reduced when treated with noni, alone or in combination with cisplatin alone (44). The antitumor effects of damnacanthal from noni are attributed to its inhibitory effects on the HGF/c-Met axis in human hepatocellular carcinoma cells, with decreases in Akt phosphorylation and matrix metalloproteinase-2 secretion (39). Noni extract induced apoptosis, G1/S phase cell-cycle arrest, and decreased intracellular ROS generation and mitochondrial membrane potential in breast cancer cells (47)."}

Increasing the intake of polyunsaturated fatty acids has been shown to increase lipid peroxidation. Supplementation with omega-3 fatty acids, therefore, may increase oxidative stress on the body. Studies have shown that mucosal alpha-tocopherol levels decrease upon omega-3 fatty acid supplementation, which researchers believe may result from the body\u2019s attempt to counteract the added oxidative burden (11).

One study showed that pao pereira induces apoptosis in pancreatic cells in vitro and in vivo via cleavage of caspases 3 and 8 and PARP, associated with DNA damage and cell cycle inhibition (8). In the prostate cancer cell line LNCaP, reduced tumor cell growth and induced apoptosis by pao pereira extract may occur via beta-carboline alkaloids that upregulate DNA repair response genes as well as genes involved in the apoptotic pathway (6). Another study suggests the extract induces cell growth arrest and apoptosis in LNCaP cells partially via inhibition of nuclear factor kappa B (NF\u03baB) activation, which is responsible for cell survival (7)."}

An isolated benzoflavone moiety is suspected as being the strongest aromatase inhibitor in passionflower, although the flavone chrysin also has these properties (26).\nIn an animal reproductive and developmental study, passionflower produced sexual behavioral disruption in male adult rats that was not accompanied by alterations in plasma testosterone levels, reproductive-related organs, and glands weights or sperm count, and was potentially attributed to aromatase inhibition (27). In seizure models, protection against post-ictal depression not seen with diazepam controls point to activity from metabolites in passionflower rather than as a result of its seizure suppression effects (21).\nPassionflower also exhibits mild anti-inflammatory activity.

It is used in traditional medicine in Asia where it is often mixed with other medicinal mushrooms, such as Reishi and Maitake, and promoted as an adjunctive treatment during cancer therapy. Some preparations of PL are used to prevent wrinkles and aging but clinical evidence is lacking. The polysaccharide-protein complexes found in PL were shown to have immunomodulating effects (1). The polyphenolic constituent demonstrated anti-inflammatory properties, which may protect against injury and other syndromes involving infarcts, hematomas or hemorrhages in animal models (2) (3). Other constituents, such as interfungins A, help prevent protein modification in hyperglycemic state, and may benefit diabetics (4).\n\nPL is being researched for its potential chemoprotective effects.

In non-obese diabetic mice, a polysaccharide extract from PL enhanced function of macrophages, dendritic cells, NK cells, T cells and B cells, prevented inflammation by inhibiting IFN-gamma, IL-2 and TNF-alpha by TH1 cells and macrophages; it also upregulated IL-4 expression in TH2 cells. These effects may help prevent diabetes (23).\nThe anti-inflammatory activities of inotilone, a compound isolated from PL might be due to reduced levels of malondialdehyde (MDA), inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), COX-2, NF-\u03baB, and matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-9, and via increased activities of catalase (CAT), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) through the suppression of TNF-\u03b1 and nitric oxide (NO) (25).\nHispidin, a phenolic compound present in PL, was shown to protect against peroxynitrite-mediated cytotoxicity, DNA damage and hydroxyl radical formation (26). PL also inhibited proliferation of SW480, a human colon cancer cell line via decreasing Bcl-2 and cyclin B1, and increasing cytochrome C (9). Another study similarly found that a PL extract induced G0/G1 arrest and apoptosis in human colon carcinoma HT29 cells, through p21(C1P1/WAF1) upregulation, cyclin D1 downregulation, Bcl2 downregulation, release of cytochrome C and activation of caspases 9, 3 and 8 (10). Decrease in cyclin-dependent kinases CDK2, 4 and 6, and dose-dependent apoptosis of lung cancer cells after treatment with PL were also observed (12). Further, it suppressed aryl hydrocarbon receptor activity and AhR-dependent gene expression, both pathways activated by cigarette smoking (13)."}

The fruit juice extracted from the arils of the seeds is used in drinks and as a dietary supplement. Several studies have shown that pomegranate has antioxidant and antiatherosclerotic properties which are attributed to the presence of multiple polyphenols such as tannins, flavonols, anthocyanins, and ellagic acid (1) (2).\nConsumption of pomegranate juice was found to benefit patients with carotid artery stenosis (6), hypertension (7), hyperlipidemia (21), or mild to moderate erectile dysfunction (19), as well as patients with coronary heart disease (8), but had no effect in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (9). A systematic review determined the evidence on pomegranate supplementation for blood pressure management is limited (34). In a study of postmenopausal women, intake of pomegranate seed oil did not reduce hot flashes (22).\nIn preclinical studies, pomegranate juice suppressed inflammatory cell signaling (1), inhibited prostate tumor growth, and lowered serum PSA levels (3) (4). It also inhibited aromatase activity, endogenous estrogen biosynthesis, and breast cancer cell proliferation (5). A pomegranate seed extract alleviated ciplatin-induced hepatotoxicity in animal studies (23).\nIn prostate cancer patients, the safety and utility of pomegranate has been studied neoadjuvantly, during active surveillance or with biochemical recurrence, and in those with advanced cancer. Pomegranate extract before surgery resulted in pomegranate metabolite accumulation in prostate tissue, but did not significantly lower 8-OHdG levels, a measure of oxidative damage (35). Although pomegranate juice slowed the rate of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) increase in men with high PSA levels, data are conflicting (2) (24). A planned subset analysis suggests that those with the manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) AA genotype might benefit (36). Supplementation with a blend of green tea, pomegranate, broccoli, and curcumin resulted in lower rates of PSA increase among men with prostate cancer following a PSA relapse post-radical treatment (25). An adjunctive intervention with pomegranate juice in men with advanced prostate cancer did not produce significant PSA reductions versus placebo (37).\nRecent investigations suggest pomegranate extract can modulate gene expression for both osteoclastic and osteogenic processes in postmenopausal women, suggesting a possible role in bone health (26), but there was no overall association between pomegranate juice intake and hormonal biomarkers for breast cancer risk (38). Pomegranate extract influenced changes in gene expression in colon tissues from colorectal patients (27). In newly-diagnosed CRC patients, pomegranate consumption may lower plasma LPS-binding protein levels, a marker for endotoxemia (33). More studies are needed to determine the implications of such changes.\nAlthough animal studies suggested pomegranate may inhibit cytochrome P450 3A and 2C9 (10) (11) (18), humans studies have not shown clinically relevant interactions (12) (39) (40) (41).", "food_sources": "Whole fruit, juice", "mechanism_of_action": "Several studies have indicated that pomegranate juice has antioxidant and antiatherosclerotic properties due to the presence of multiple polyphenols such as tannins, flavonols, anthocyanins and ellagic acid. Punicalagin, an ellagitannin, is the most abundant polyphenol that accounts for >50% of antioxidant activity (1) (2).\nAnimal models indicate that constituents such as ellagic acid and luteolin inhibit metastasis of ovarian cancer by downregulating matrix metalloproteinases MMP2 and MMP9 (28). In prostate cancer cells, a pomegranate extract induced apoptosis and impaired metastasis, also by downregulating MMP2/MMP9 along with upregulating tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase TIMP2 (29). Prevention of chemically-induced mammary carcinogenesis by another extract likely involved anti-inflammatory mechanisms such as differential regulation of nuclear factor-\u03baB (NF-\u03baB) and nuclear factor erythroid 2p45 (NF-E2)-related factor 2 (Nrf2) signaling (30). A pomegranate extract suppressed breast cancer stem cell characteristics by inhibiting the epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) (31). However, pomegranate extract can also inhibit aromatase activity and decrease the endogenous synthesis of estrogen (5).\nSome commercial pomegranate juices are marketed with claims of higher antioxidant activity than green tea and red wine (13). However such effects could be due to colonic microflora metabolites and not the polyphenols present in the juice (14).

Following revisions over the years, probiotics are currently defined by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the World Health Organization as \u201clive microorganisms, which when consumed in adequate amounts, confer a health effect on the host\u201d (2). Most probiotics consist of lactic-acid producing, non-virulent bacteria, such as Lactobacillus, Streptococcus, Bifidobacterium, Propionibacterium and Enterococcus or non-pathogenic yeasts such as Saccharomyces boulardii. Probiotics have gained immense popularity over the last two decades for their perceived health benefits which include improved digestion, immune function and nutrient absorption but the most important being the reversal of dysbiosis (changes in the function or composition of gut microbes or \u201cmicrobiota\u201d) that is hypothesized to play a role in the development of several chronic and degenerative diseases (3). Although gut microbiota is known to develop at birth, nutrition, lifestyle, and changes in the host genome during later years can shift its makeup and activity, which in turn influences overall health and the risk of developing disease. Antibiotic use can also disrupt the balance between beneficial and harmful bacteria (4) (5). Probiotic supplementation is currently promoted for the prevention and treatment of inflammatory bowel disease, gastroenteritis, irritable bowel syndrome, allergies, dental cavities, and for the management of diarrhea induced by antibiotics, by the bacterium Clostridium difficile (C. difficile), and that associated with chemotherapy (64). However, authoritative guidelines for probiotic use have not yet been established nor is there a consensus about the minimum number of microorganisms needed to derive benefits.\nProbiotics have been evaluated in randomized controlled trials and the strongest evidence of their effectiveness is for acute infectious diarrhea, the main cause of acute gastroenteritis (7). Probiotic supplementation also was shown useful in alleviating antibiotic-associated diarrhea (8). Although randomized trials did not find any benefit for managing C. difficile-associated diarrhea (9), a meta analysis suggests moderate quality evidence to support use of probiotics for preventing C. difficile infection (63). The role of probiotics in the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) has been the focus of many studies and available data support their efficacy for pouchitis (inflammation of the ileal pouch in post-colectomy patients). Interestingly, even though a range of products were shown useful in treating and sustaining remissions of mild to moderately active ulcerative colitis, findings of Crohn\u2019s disease are not promising (65). Based on the association of intestinal bacteria with symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), probiotic supplementation has been explored in a few studies. Although current data are encouraging, well-designed trials to support use are lacking (11). And analyses of the National Health and Nutrition survey results revealed that consumption of yogurt or probiotics reduces the risk of proteinuric kidney disease (12), but definitive conclusions about the role of probiotics for the treatment of urinary tract infections (13) or bacterial vaginosis (60) are lacking. Probiotic use was also shown to increase resistance to risk factors associated with dental caries in a randomized trial (14), and to improve memory impairment in a murine model (15). The utility of probiotics in preventing allergies has been addressed as well, with studies showing a moderate benefit for eczema prevention but not for other allergic conditions (16). Probiotic supplementation was also shown useful for the reduction of glycemic and inflammatory markers in patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (58). But evidence to support its role in managing cystic fibrosis is lacking (61).\nAs increasing evidence indicates that gut bacteria are important determinants of metabolic disorders, probiotics are being investigated as a possible therapeutic option. Thus far, beneficial effects have been reported against obesity and diabetes in mice and in humans (17). Meta analyses suggest that probiotic supplementation helps prevent oral candidiasis in the elderly (62), may lower fasting blood glucose level in adults (59) and may also improve lipid metabolism by lowering the levels of LDL and total cholesterol (18).\nAnother important application of probiotic therapy is in pediatrics for the treatment of gastrointestinal disorders and allergies. Meta analyses indicate that enteral supplementation of probiotics is effective in preventing severe necrotizing enterocolitis in preterm infants (19). And a significant reduction in acute diarrhea was reported in children, independent of the bacterial strains employed (7). Studies also indicate efficacy of probiotics against antibiotic-associated diarrhea (20). But available evidence does not support use for allergic diseases (21), and data are insufficient to assess effects in children with short bowel syndrome, a malabsorption disorder (22).\nPreliminary studies also suggest that probiotics may have anti-carcinogenic potential. Preclinical data show that oral administration of Lactobacillus casei BL23 has a protective effect against dimethyl hydrazine-induced colorectal cancer (23), and a probiotic mixture attenuated the growth of hepatocellular carcinoma (24). Data from a large epidemiological study suggest an association between consumption of non-pasteurized dairy products and lower incidence of colorectal cancer (25). Probiotics may also aid in controlling symptoms associated with cancer treatments. Results from a systematic review showed a reduction in the severity and frequency of treatment-associated diarrhea, and the need for anti-diarrheal medication in cancer patients following probiotic supplementation (26). In other studies, perioperative probiotic treatment reduced surgical site infections in patients undergoing colorectal cancer surgery (27) and improved bowel function (28). More studies are underway (29).\nIn addition to probiotics, other strategies used to modulate gut microbiota that have recently gained attention include \u201cprebiotics\u201d and \u201cfecal microbiota transplantation\u201d (FMT). Prebiotics, also known as functional foods, are non-digestible food ingredients that benefit the host by selectively promoting growth or activity of helpful gut bacteria. Currently used prebiotics include the fructans inulin and fructo-oligosaccharides (FOS), galacto-oligosaccharides (GOS), and lactulose. A few studies have evaluated the utility of prebiotics for IBS but data are conflicting (11). Because probiotics are short-lived, prebiotics are being co-administered to maintain their levels in the gut. This combination of pro- and prebiotics is called \u201csynbiotic therapy\u201d that has been shown useful in controlling symptoms associated with IBS (30). FMT involves administration of fecal matter from a healthy donor into a recipient by enema, colonoscopy or through the upper gastrointestinal tract in the form of oral capsules, via nasogastric, nasoduodenal or nasoenteric tube, or by endoscopy, to restore normal gut flora. Some studies indicate that FMT might benefit IBS patients, but the quality of evidence is low. Further research is needed (31).\nAlthough an increasing number of studies suggest that probiotics improve health by inducing favorable changes in the intestinal bacteria, the overall evidence to support their use is limited due to small sample size, poor methodology, variation in the species and strains of bacteria, and in the dosage and duration of administration. Variation in the response to probiotics is also an important factor to consider because genes that respond to probiotic intake were shown to be strain-specific (32) and to cluster according to the individual and not by intervention (32) (33). Well-designed studies and specific recommendations are needed to establish probiotic use for different age groups and disorders.\nProbiotics are generally considered safe, but their long-term safety has not been determined. Bacteremia, fungemia, and endocarditis have been reported following use in newborns and in immunocompromised individuals.", "food_sources": "Yogurt, miso, tempeh, kefir, pickled vegetables, sauerkraut, kimchi and buttermilk", "mechanism_of_action": "Suggested mechanisms by which probiotics influence colonization in the gut include production of inhibitory compounds to suppress the growth of pathogenic microorganisms, and production of substrates to promote the growth of beneficial bacteria. Probiotics can also indirectly influence shifts in microbiota by interacting with the mucosal system, which affects systemic immunity; and by reducing pro-inflammatory markers implicated in many disorders (34) (35).\nStudies using murine models indicate that administration of S. boulardii to type-2 diabetic and obese mice resulted in reduced inflammation, body weight, fat mass, and hepatic steatosis, along with decreased bacterial population that has been previously associated with obesity and type-2 diabetes (36). Probiotic treatment also affected a reduction in food intake and an improvement in glucose tolerance via release of the hormone glucagon-like protein-1 (GLP-1), a physiological regulator of appetite and food intake (37).\nImmunomodulation is one of the ways in which probiotics are thought to influence host health. A subspecies of Bifidobacterium longum prevented Salmonella-associated infection in mice by inducing T-regulatory cells and by attenuating the activation of nuclear factor-kappa B, which plays a role in the expression of pro-inflammatory genes (38). Induction of T-regulatory cells was also shown in humans along with a reduction in pro-inflammatory biomarkers (39). In addition probiotic administration was shown to reduce pain perception, and to induce changes in the colonic expression of genes that mediate pain and inflammation (40). And a probiotic mixture reduced the growth of hepatocellular carcinoma by shifting the gut microbes toward beneficial bacteria, which produce anti-inflammatory metabolites (24). Protective effects of probiotics were also reported in a murine model of mammary carcinogenesis. Oral administration of a supplement containing Lactobacillus reuteri resulted in inhibition of mammary tumor formation by triggering CD4+/CD25+ lymphocytes, which play a critical role in controlling immune responses (41). Because intestinal bacteria have been shown to influence carcinogenesis and response to anticancer therapy, manipulating them selectively may be a potential strategy to enhance the efficacy of anticancer treatments (66)."}

It has been used in folk medicine and in food and beverages to improve health and prevent disease. Propolis is thought to have antibacterial, antiviral, antifungal, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, immunostimulatory, antiproliferative, vasomodulatory, cardioprotective, and radioprotective properties (2) (3) (15) (16).\nIn vitro studies demonstrate synergistic antimicrobial effects when propolis is used with honey or ethyl alcohol (17) . Propolis also enhanced the antitumor effects of temozolomide in human glioblastoma cell lines (18). Another study found propolis to have greater cytotoxic activity against human lung adenocarcinoma and fibrosarcoma cells compared with 5-fluorouracil (7). Propolis and several of its constituents demonstrated anticancer activities in several human cancer cell lines (19) (20) (21) (22) (23).\nIn animal models, propolis and its constituents have demonstrated cardiovascular (24), wound-healing (25) (26), and antitumor activities (27) (28).\nDespite the number of laboratory studies, very few clinical trials of propolis have been conducted. Topical propolis extract may be helpful in treat fungal foot infections, but confirmatory studies are needed (29). A pilot study suggests ethanolic propolis extract reduces microbial count and improves symptoms from periodontal treatment (30). Clinical data also show propolis to be an effective adjuvant treatment for asthma (4), and to treat plane and common warts (5). A propolis/zinc suspension reduced the number of acute otitis media infections in children (6).\nOnly a few trials evaluate propolis for cancer and treatment-related mucositis. In a pilot randomized placebo-controlled double-blind study, supplemental propolis was not effective for colon cancer prevention and suggested negative effects on muscle tissues including myocardial cells (31). The effects of propolis on chemotherapy-induced mucositis are thus far equivocal with results from only two small double-blind controlled trials: one in adults with grade 2/3 mucositis found benefits with both the topical application of honey and a proprietary mixture of honey, olive oil-propolis extract, and beeswax compared with controls (32), but another in pediatric patients with severe mucositis self-administering topical propolis alone did not find benefit (33). An open-label study evaluating a mucoadhesive propolis gel for mucositis did find benefit, but confirmatory studies are needed (34).\nBee pollen, a constituent of propolis, is a mixture of plant pollens, nectar, and bee saliva that bees form into granules to store as food (8). It is claimed as a \u201ccure all\u201d by some and is touted for its antiaging and stamina-increasing properties, antioxidant effects, and for chronic prostatitis, among other conditions. Aside from its nutritional value, clinical data show that bee pollen has limited benefits in improving athletic performance (9) (10).\nThe use of propolis and bee pollen is relatively benign. However, hypersensitivity reactions to each of these supplements have been reported.\nIn addition, although a number of laboratory studies indicate anticancer effects, propolis or its constituents may also act as pro-oxidants (35), produce cytotoxic effects in normal cells (31) (36) (37) (38), and/or have mutagenic activity (39) (40) under certain circumstances indicating that risk versus benefit also needs further evaluation.", "food_sources": " ", "mechanism_of_action": "In vitro studies have identified a number of active propolis constituents and their potential mechanisms. Generally, antimicrobial and antioxidant activities are related to total phenolic contents (15); caffeic acid phenethyl ester (CAPE) and artepillin C are well-known anti-inflammatory components (25); and the main active anticancer constituents are CAPE and chrysin (23). However, all of these constituents also possess these other characteristics to some degree and vary with geographic origin.\nCAPE specifically inhibits nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kB) (41). In human breast cancer cells, it also inhibits MDR gene expression, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) (20). CAPE decreased malignancy potential of breast cancer stem cells via inhibition of self-renewal, progenitor formation, and clonal growth, and significantly decreased CD44 expression (42). CAPE-initiated S- and G2/M-phase cell-cycle arrests and apoptosis in human cervical cancer lines was associated with increased E2F-1 expression (43).\nThe flavonoid chrysin demonstrated photoprotective effects by attenuating UVA- and UVB-induced apoptosis, reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, and cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2) expression (44). Chrysin is an inhibitor of aromatase, an enzyme converting testosterone into estrogen (39). It is also a histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor and inhibited HDAC8 enzymatic activity and tumor growth in human breast cancer cell lines (23). Chrysin may overcome tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) resistance through Mcl-1 downregulation via STAT3 phosphorylation inhibition (45). A novel chrysin-organogermanium complex demonstrated inhibitory effects across several human cancer cell lines, with high selectivity between cancer cells and normal cells causing membrane toxicity as demonstrated by decreased cell rigidity and adhesion force, and apoptosis via ROS-dependent mitochondrial pathways (46).\nThe phenolic compound artepillin C is the major constituent that stimulates pungent taste by activating TRPA1 channels (47). Its immune-modulating effects are attributed to suppression of interleukin (IL)-2, interferon (IFN)-gamma and IL-17 expression in alloreactive CD4 T cells, suggesting its potential in treating graft versus host disease (48). Artepillin C also sensitizes prostate cancer cells to TRAIL-induced apoptosis by engaging both extrinsic receptor-mediated and intrinsic mitochondrial apoptotic pathways (21). In different tumor cell lines, artepillin C and baccharin were found to be more cytotoxic than propolis, without additive or synergistic effects when combined (49).\nInduction and/or inhibition of hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha (HIF-1) and HIF-1 target genes also been demonstrated with other constituents, including polyphenols, cinnamic acid derivatives baccharin and drupanin, and the flavonoids beturetol and isosakuranetin (50) (51). Baccharin plus drupanin particularly exerted synergistic growth-inhibitory effects, via intrinsic and extrinsic apoptotic signaling transduction and by modulating miRNA expression (22). Baccharin demonstrates highly selective inhibition of human aldo-keto reductase superfamily (AKR1C3), and suppressed proliferation of PC3 prostate cancer cells stimulated by AKR1C3 overexpression (52). A synthesized baccharin derivative also demonstrated AKR1C3 inhibition (53).\nSeveral compounds mostly belonging to the polycyclic polyprenylated acylphloroglucinols class demonstrated selective targeting of chemotherapy-refractory neuroblastoma cancer stem cells by acting in a pleiotropic manner, including strong disruption of tubulin polymerization and inhibition of replicative enzymes like toposimerases I/II and DNA polymerase (54).\nIn vitro studies of propolis as a whole demonstrate significant free-radical scavenging activity and anti-inflammatory effects by modulating key inflammatory mediators of mRNA transcription, inhibiting specific inflammatory cytokines, and blocking NF-kB activation (55). Propolis was also found to inhibit proliferation and induce apoptosis in human leukemia cells through activation of caspase-3 via the mitochondrial pathway (2). Apoptotic induction in human breast cancer cells occurs partly through endoplasmic reticulum stress-related signaling (19), and synergy between propolis and temozolomide in human glioblastoma cell lines is also partly attributed to reduced NF-kB activity (18).\nIn animal models, an ethanolic propolis extract may enhance reverse cholesterol transport via stimulated plasma HDL levels and hepatic ABCA1 and ABCG1 expression (24). Propolis promotes wound-healing by exerting effects on mast cells that result in downregulation of type I allergy and inflammation (25) and modifying fibronectin metabolism (26). Immunomodulatory effects occurred through increased toll-like receptor expression and IL-1beta and IL-6 production (12). Pretreatment with orally-administered propolis extract reduced doxorubicin-induced oxidative damage to heart mitochondria (3). Diabetic hepatorenal damage was attentuated via antioxidant activity including free-radical scavenging, and was more pronounced in ethanol than water extracts (56). In human colon cancer models, oral propolis at doses that caused no detectable toxicity was associated with a decrease in mitotic cells and Ki-67 expression as well as increased endoreduplications and p53 expression, and apoptosis in leukemia cells was associated with downregulation of Bcl-2 and Bax activation (27)."}

A randomized controlled trial also failed to find sufficient evidence to support use of PEs for preventing mucositis (13). Further, results from a study involving patients with inoperable pancreatic cancer showed a decrease in overall survival and poorer quality of life with PEs compared with standard gemcitabine-based chemotherapy (14).

Red wine is a natural source of resveratrol as it is rich in grape skin and seeds. However, resveratrol is usually consumed as a dietary supplement for its purported antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. It is also marketed as an anti-aging supplement based on findings that it prolongs the life span of yeast cells (1) (2). This effect has not yet been demonstrated in humans.\nA long-term randomized double-blind trial indicates that resveratrol and its major metabolites penetrate the blood-brain barrier to have effects on some biomarkers associated with Alzheimer\u2019s disease (45), but a meta-analysis did not find any significant effect on memory or cognitive performance (47). Recent double-blind trials have also not found benefit with resveratrol on cognitive function in older adults (52) (53).\nResveratrol is also thought to have cardioprotective effects. Earlier studies found it reduces low density lipoprotein (LDL) oxidation, inhibits platelet aggregation, and may protect against atherogenesis (3) (4). Consumption of wine or a resveratrol-rich grape supplement is associated with reduced risk of cardiovascular disease (5) (6) and may help promote circulatory system health (7) (8) (9). However, it does not decrease risk of all-cause mortality in older adults (42). Data on effectiveness of resveratrol against non-alcoholic fatty liver disease are conflicting (44) (48).\nResveratrol may increase insulin sensitivity in diabetic patients (10) (11) (43), and supplementation improved arterial stiffness and reduced oxidative stress (50). However, it did not improve metabolic patterns or reduce C-reactive protein (46), and data on whether it controls metabolic syndrome in obese subjects are inconclusive (12) (13). Other studies suggest benefit with resveratrol in diabetic patients on bone density and levels of SIRT-1, a key protein in metabolism and inflammation (54) (55). It may also help as adjunctive therapy to improve symptoms in rheumatoid and osteoarthritis (56) (57).\nPreclinical experiments suggest that resveratrol has antiproliferative (14) (15) (16) (17) (18) (19) and antioxidant effects (58). In combination with radiation exposure, it exhibited dose-dependent radioprotective (59) (60) (61), radiomodulatory (62), radiosensitizing (63), cytotoxic (64), and neuroprotective (65) effects. Other experiments suggest effects including chemotherapeutic potentiation (66) (67) and protection against chemo-induced cardiotoxicity (20).\nHowever, data on use of resveratrol in cancer patients are quite limited. In phase 1 pilots of colorectal cancer patients, one study suggests resveratrol may decrease tumor cell proliferation (41) while another suggests utility may be limited to prevention rather than established cancers (68). Study of a high-dose micronized formula in multiple myeloma patients was stopped due to serious adverse events that included renal failure (69). In addition, resveratrol exhibits estrogen-like properties and activates transcription by both estrogen and androgen receptors that can lead to the stimulation of cancer cell proliferation (18). Therefore, larger well-designed trials are needed to determine the circumstances under which resveratrol might demonstrate utility and safety.\nWhereas resveratrol appears to be well tolerated in some studies, high doses can cause gastrointestinal side effects such as diarrhea. It also inhibits cytochrome P450 enzymes (22) (23) and may increase the risk of adverse effects of certain drugs. Given its phytoestrogenic properties and potential for interactions, use of this supplement should be discussed with the treating physician.", "food_sources": ["Grape skins and seeds", "Peanuts, pistachios", "Mulberries, blueberries, cranberries", "Polygonum cuspidatum or Japanese knotweed"], "mechanism_of_action": "Resveratrol acts as an antioxidant and inhibits oxidation of low density lipoproteins (LDL) (21), platelet aggregation, and eicosanoid synthesis (4); induces nitric oxide (NO) production (24) (25) and increases arterial blood flow (8). These actions may contribute to its purported cardiovascular health benefits. Resveratrol also acts as an anti-inflammatory agent by inhibiting cyclooxygenase (COX) activity (26). It has been shown to decrease C-reactive protein and tumor necrosis factor, and to increase anti-inflammatory interleukin-10 and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 in humans (5). Other effects include decreasing oxidative stress and improving insulin sensitivity by increasing protein kinase activities (10). Resveratrol was also shown to decrease circulating insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-I) and IGF-binding protein-3 (IGFBP-3) levels (27) which may account for its anti-diabetic effects in humans. Preliminary data suggest that it increases the life span of yeast cells by activating sirtuins (1) (2), inhibiting human Sirt3 along with stimulating Sirt5 and Sirt1 (28). The neuroprotective effects of resveratrol were shown to be via regulating autophagy and apoptosis mediated by the Akt/mTOR pathway (51).\nResveratrol has also been investigated for its anticancer potential. It was found to inhibit proliferation of cancer cells via apoptosis and by exerting anti-estrogenic effects (14) (15) (16) (17). Trans-resveratrol appears to decrease methylation of the tumor suppressor gene RASSF-1alpha in women at increased breast cancer risk (29). In addition, reductions in breast cancer cell migration and invasion were observed after supplementation (30) (31). Resveratrol growth factor heregulin-beta1 (HRG-beta1) mediated matrix metallopeptidase 9 (MMP-9) expressions in human breast cancer cells (30). However, contradictory data show that resveratrol mimics phytoestrogens and could activate genes that are normally regulated by estrogens (18) or androgens (19). In other studies resveratrol helped reduce prostate tumorigenesis through a reduction in prostatic levels of mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) activity and increased expression of SIRT1 (32); and modulated steroid hormone-dependent pathways to inhibit prostate cancer cell growth.

It is involved in the formation of monoamine neurotransmitters such as serotonin and norepinephrine (28). Decreased SAM-e levels in cerebrospinal fluid are thought to contribute to the etiologies of depression and Alzheimer\u2019s disease (29) (30). SAM-e levels may also be decreased in chronic liver disease (31) and AIDS-associated myelopathy (32). In the United States, SAM-e is marketed as a supplement to enhance mood, brain and neural function, joint mobility, and liver detoxification. It is also a prescription drug in other countries.\nPreclinical data suggest that SAM-e may have antidepressive (33), neuroprotective (34), anti-inflammatory (35), and chondroprotective (36) effects. Other models suggest liver injury can be exacerbated by depleted SAM-e levels, and that supplementation may have hepatoprotective effects (31).\nIn humans, data on whether SAM-e is an effective adjunct for major depressive disorder are mixed (16) (27), and a large trial did not find benefit with SAM-e over escitalopram or placebo for major depressive disorder (37). Another study suggests benefit compared with escitalopram or placebo (20), but its therapeutic potential may be greater in men (21). A Cochrane review cites an absence of quality evidence (22), while a meta-analysis suggests adjunctive potential (23). Other preliminary data suggest SAM-e may improve memory-related cognitive symptoms in depressed patients (17). However, studies that suggest cognitive benefits for patients with Alzheimer\u2019s disease do not evaluate SAM-e in isolation (28).\nAlthough results are mixed, a few clinical trials of SAM-e for osteoarthritis suggest benefit comparable with NSAIDs (14) (15) (38). For hot flashes, SAM-e was ineffective compared with historical placebo (39). It also did not significantly improve neurological measures in patients with AIDS-associated myelopathy (32). Preliminary trials suggest some benefit in fibromyalgia patients (40) (41), but larger studies are needed.\nSome trials have suggested benefit with oral SAM-e in patients with chronic liver disease (42). Addition of oral SAM-e to injected pegylated interferon alpha (pegIFN alpha) and oral ribavirin improved viral response in patients with chronic hepatitis C (18). Postoperative intravenous SAM-e therapy improved residual liver function in patients with cirrhosis (19). However, in patients with hepatitis C cirrhosis at elevated risk for hepatocellular carcinoma, oral SAM-e did not improve liver function, or reduce injury or oxidative stress (24). A small open-label study suggests oral SAM-e may be useful as adjunctive palliative therapy in patients with advanced biliary tract carcinoma (25). Other preliminary analyses suggest protective effects with SAM-e against chemotherapy-induced liver toxicity (43) (44) (45). Additional confirmatory studies are needed to assess efficacy and safety.\nWhile generally well-tolerated, the therapeutic value of SAM-e in chronic liver disease is limited (26) or yet to be determined. Because it is poorly absorbed, enteric-coated tablets are preferred. Outside the United States, parenteral formulations are used to treat fibromyalgia (9), osteoarthritis, and tendonitis as well as depression.

Homocysteine is formed through the transsulfuration pathway and is catabolized to cysteine and indirectly to glutathione.\nIn preclinical models, SAM-e protected against amyloid-beta-induced cellular injury by inhibiting oxidative stress and neuroinflammation (34). It also increased the endogenous antioxidant glutathione and potentiated antioxidant enzyme activity. Supplementation with SAM-e restores hepatic glutathione (GSH) deposits and attenuates liver injury (26). The mechanism by which SAM-e might treat depression is unknown, but increased synthesis of neurotransmitters such as serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine, may increase responsiveness of neurotransmitter receptors and fluidity of cell membranes in the production of phospholipids (2) (3) (4)."}

The fruits are a rich source of fatty acids and phytosterols and have been used to promote urination, reduce inflammation, and for treatment of conditions such as benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH).\nVarious heterogeneous extracts of saw palmetto are available, but many basic research and clinical trials used a hexanic extract of S. repens, which has anti-inflammatory, anti-androgenic, and antiproliferative activity (36) (37). Whereas some data indicate that various saw palmetto extracts improve lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) in patients with BPH (2) (3) (4) (5) (15) (17) (18) (26), conflicting data suggest no such effects (6) (14) (19) (28) (38). In another large study, a saw palmetto extract did not affect serum prostate specific antigen (PSA) more than placebo even at high doses (30). Pretreatment with saw palmetto reduced intra- and postoperative complications in patients who underwent transurethral resection of the prostate and open prostatectomy (22). A saw palmetto extract was found to inhibit growth of normal prostate cells and increase their sensitivity to radiation in vitro, but did not affect malignant prostate cancer cells (20). A large epidemiologic study did not find associations with the use of saw palmetto and reduced risk of prostate cancer (27).\nIn an exploratory study, a hexanic extract of S. repens demonstrated anti-inflammatory effects in patients with BPH-related LUTS, (39). In an open-label study, saw palmetto extract plus tamsulosin was found to be more effective than tamsulosin-only to reduce storage symptoms in BPH patients (40).\nMulti-phytotherapy approaches have also been investigated. One study suggests saw palmetto may benefit patients with chronic bacterial prostatitis when coadministered with nettle, curcumin, and quercitin (16). Along with selenium and lycopene, saw palmetto exerted anti-inflammatory effects (31). In addition, patients with LUTS had greater improvement in International Prostate Symptom Scores (IPSS) and increased urine flow with this combination therapy in addition to tamsulosin therapy than with either single therapy (41).\nDue to the increased risk of normal tissue complications, patients should consult with a physician before using saw palmetto supplements during radiation therapy.

Further, the extract inhibited binding of DHT to its receptor (8) and blocked conversion of testosterone to DHT by inhibiting 5-alpha-reductase activity (9). The berries also inhibit cyclooxygenase and 5-lipoxygenase pathways, thereby preventing the biosynthesis of inflammation-producing prostaglandins and leukotrienes (10). Other possible mechanisms attributed to benefits in BPH include the blocking of estrogen receptor activity in the prostate as well as bladder muscle antispasmodic and anti-inflammatory activities (42). Possible mechanisms by which saw palmetto could cause hot flashes and vasomotor symptoms especially in children include its antiestrogenic activity influencing physiological endocrine activity and increased availability of sex hormone-binding globulin (35) (43).\nStudies of a hexanic extract of S. repens suggests it decreases prostaglandin and leukotriene production to inhibit the arachidonic acid cascade and decreases B lymphocyte infiltrates and interleukin (IL)-1b and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-a levels to adjust inflammatory status and gene expression (36). In animal models of prostate hyperplasia, it demonstrated a global anti-inflammatory effect on hyperplastic prostates with lobe-specific anti-androgenic effects (44). In human prostate and vascular cells in an inflammatory environment, it also decreases monocyte chemotactic protein-1 production and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 expression (37). In human prostate carcinoma cells, inhibitory effects on cell growth were attributed to downregulation of inflammatory-related genes and activation of nuclear factor-kappa B pathway (45).\nA chalcanonol glycoside from the seeds of saw palmetto as well as sterolic derivatives have demonstrated antiproliferative effects (46)."}

Animal studies also suggest cardio- and liver-protective effects (10) (11) (12). Schisandra appeared to enhance endurance and metabolism (13), improve cognitive functioning (14), and exhibit antimicrobial (15), antioxidant, neuroprotective (16), and anti-hyperglycemic activities (17) (18) (19) in other preclinical models. Active lignans isolated from schisandra, particularly schisandrin A, appeared to reverse P-glycoprotein (Pgp)-mediated multidrug resistance of various cancer cell lines to doxorubicin, vincristine, and paclitaxel (20).\nVery few human trials have been performed with this supplement. Small clinical trials suggest improvements in patients with fatty liver disease or hepatitis C when used in combination with other substances (21) (22). In liver transplant patients, schisandra appeared to reduce tacrolimus-associated side-effects of diarrhea and agitation and improve liver function (24). In a small study of renal transplant patients who were CYP3A5 expressers, a schisandra preparation reduced tacrolimus dosing requirements, improved initial dose accuracy, and resulted in fewer dose changes (38). In small studies of women, schisandra did not induce significant changes in obesity-related measures (39), but was helpful for menopausal symptoms (40).

In vitro, schisantherins downregulated pro-inflammatory cytokines and mediators by blocking NF-\u03baB and MAPK signaling (1). The anthocyanin Cya-3-O-xylrut has been identified as responsible for its antioxidant activity (18).\nIn animal toxicity models, pretreatment with schisandra lignans provided liver-protective effects via increased DT-diaphorase activity (10), and improved Phase I drug metabolism  (28) (29). Schisandra also increased hepatic glutathione levels and glucose-6-phosphate and glutathione reductase activities (17). It lowered blood glucose levels via inhibition of \u03b1-glucosidase activity  (19), and improved post-ischemic cardiac function by downregulating inflammatory cytokines, activating the eNOS pathway, inhibiting apoptosis, and enhancing cell proliferation (12). In amyloid-beta-induced memory impairment, schisandra increased superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase activities and glutathione levels in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus of mice while decreasing malondialdehyde and oxidized glutathione (14). It also enhanced endurance and metabolism in rat skeletal muscle by upregulating PGC-1\u03b1 expression (13).\nIn human renal cell carcinoma cells, a schisandra polysaccharide identified as SCP induced apoptosis via caspase-3 and -9 activation, increased PARP cleavage, and inactivation of the ERK pathway (8). Another polysaccharide known as SCPP11 exhibited antitumor effects in hepatic cancer models via increased thymus index as well as serum IL-2 and TNF-alpha levels, and enhanced phagocytosis and NO production (26). Pgp-mediated chemotherapy drug-resistance in various cancer cell lines was reversed by schisandrins through the inhibition of Pgp and total protein kinase C function/expression (20).\nSchisandra coadministration increased oral bioavailability of tacrolimus via inhibition of Pgp-mediated efflux and cytochrome P450 3A-mediated metabolism, and reduction of intestinal first-pass effect (30)."}

As part of the diverse arachnid class, scorpions possess a venomous stinger at the end of their tails used to paralyze prey or for self-defense. Although the venom is generally considered poisonous, there are varying degrees of pathogenicity and only a small fraction of scorpion species are deadly to humans (2).\nThe belief that scorpions have medicinal properties has existed for centuries, and many instances of their use have been recorded in both indigenous and folk medicine. In Traditional Chinese Medicine, the entire scorpion of the Buthus martensii Karsch (BmK) species is used to treat convulsions, spasms, and pain (3), and some laboratory studies confirm that scorpion venoms do contain antinociceptive properties (4) (5).\nScorpion venom has also been evaluated for other applications. It appears useful in killing intraerythrocytic malarial pathogens without harming the erythrocyte (6), and some species contain antimicrobial peptides that appear effective against yeast, fungi, bacteria, and viruses (7) (8). Scorpion venom could also be a source for the isolation of anticancer molecules. Preliminary assessments indicate that Tityus discrepans, Androctonus crassicauda, and Odontobuthus doriae venoms are effective inducers of apoptosis in breast cancer cell lines (9) (10) (11) . A component in BmK venom inhibits proliferation of human leukemia cells suggesting therapeutic potential in hematopoietic malignancies (12). Because the general composition and expression level of scorpion venom depends on genetic variations and geographical environments, research to identify the active components that have therapeutic potential across the various species continues (12) (13) (14).\nRhopalurus junceus, or blue scorpion venom, originated from Cuba, and is often marketed as having anticancer, anti-inflammatory, and analgesic properties. Claims for these products, known as Escozine and Escozul, are largely based on anecdotal information, testimonials, and preclinical experiments on laboratory animals. However, the manufacturers\u2019 research cannot be corroborated and has not been published in any peer-reviewed journal (15) (16). In 2009, the Cuban government formally rejected the use of Escozul due to insufficient clinical data (17). Only recently has there been a functional characterization of R. junceus in the literature, but without any clinical evidence presented for R. junceus-derived products (18). A homeopathic version, Vidatox, has since been developed and has also not been evaluated in peer-reviewed journals.\nThe more likely scenario for future benefits with scorpion venom in cancer therapy may come from clinical trials involving chlorotoxin (CTX), a scorpion venom-derived peptide. CTX may facilitate the entry of chemotherapeutic compounds into tumor cells to target drug delivery and improve efficacy (19) (20) (21). In addition, it holds the potential for reducing side effects and can be synthesized in the laboratory (22). A synthetic CTX that selectively binds to glioma and other tumors cells is being evaluated as a radiopharmaceutical to deliver therapeutic levels of radiation directly to disease sites (23) (24). A CTX/near-infrared fluorescent molecule combination is under investigation as a cancer imaging agent, a kind of \u201ctumor paint\u201d that may help surgeons more clearly identify tumor margins and micrometastases, and spare normal tissue (25) (26) (27).\nContinued research on the complex characteristics of scorpion venom among the various species is needed to both isolate the properties of therapeutic importance and develop their application in cancer research.", "food_sources": " ", "mechanism_of_action": "The sheer number of compounds and their diverse pharmacologic properties among different scorpion species leaves their mechanisms poorly understood (12) (31). Most scorpion venoms are known to contain peptide toxins that mainly act on ion channels (29). These biologically active peptides are classified as either disulfide-bridged peptides (DBPs) which are mostly responsible for neurotoxic effects, and non-disulfide-bridged (NDBPs) which have been an attractive area of research for their spectrum of biological activities (36).\nHp1036 and Hp1239 peptides are antiviral and exert inhibitory effects throughout the Herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) life cycle (37). TsAP-1 and TsAP-2 peptides possess antimicrobial and anticancer activity that can be substantially improved with increased cationicity (38). AcrAP1 and AcrAP2 analogues have also displayed enhanced antimicrobial activity and unlike the native peptides, also displayed growth modulation effects on a range of human cancer cell lines (39). Peptides are also being engineerd to produce selective therapeutic ion channel inhibitors which may have potential in the treatment of autoimmune diseases (40). A fusion protein generated from chlorotoxin inhibited matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP2) release from pancreatic cancer cells, which require their activation during invasion and migration (41).\nThe venom from R. junceus was shown to have reversible beta and alpha activities. It enabled sodium channels to open at more negative potentials, delayed inactivation of potassium channels, and rapidly blocked ERG potassium channels in neuroblastoma cells (18). Proteins found in T. discrepans venom bind to FasL and Bcl-2 on the surface of breast cancer cells inducing apoptosis (9). Buthus matensii Karsch (BmK) scorpion venom extracts inhibited human breast cancer cells by inducing apoptosis and blocking cell cycle in G0/G1 phase (42). BmK venom also induces apoptosis in human lymphoma cells by upregulating PTEN, and decreases levels of Akt and Bad phosphorylation, resulting in increased p27 expression (32). Another component of BmK venom inhibits cell proliferation by modulating NF-\u03baB activation in human leukemia cells (12). Bengalin, a high molecular weight protein from the Indian black scorpion induced autophagy in human leukemic cells through ERK-MAPK pathway (43). A. crassicauda and O. doriae venoms induce apoptosis via caspase-3 activity and nuclear DNA fragmentation in neuroblastoma and breast cancer cells (10) (11). Further, the proteolytic enzymes in scorpion venom are likely responsible for its necrotic activity (11). Leiurus quinquestriatus venom contains a chlorotoxin (CTX) associated with MMP2 that increases its affinity for primary brain tumors and reduces the potential for tumor invasion of healthy tissue (20) (21). CTX, which functions as a paralytic in nature, has a molecular structure with a single tyrosine residue available for radioiodination (33). Synthetic CTX has shown antiangiogenic properties and a synergistic effect with bevacizumab in animal models (24) and specifically binds with the protein annexin A2 in diverse tumor cell lines (34).\nAn array of other components in scorpion venoms may have therapeutic uses. BmK venom has sympathomimetic and analgesic properties (30) (35). It contains a peptide that modulates G-protein-coupled receptor activity, and has a primary structure similar to enkephalin-like peptides (31). Other venoms also exhibit antinociceptive properties which appear to be activated by an endogenous opioid system partly triggered by counterirritation (5)."}

Wogonin causes arrest at G1 phase while baicalin and baicalein cause G2/M accumulation (2). Additional studies show that baicalin, at concentrations of 50-200 mcg/ml, activates caspase-3, resulting in apoptosis of Jurkat cells (leukemia-derived T cells). However, low-dose baicalin upregulated expression of multiple angiogenic genes to increase cell proliferation in developing blood vessels, while high-dose baicalin inihbited angiognesis by inducing cell death, suggesting dose-dependent dual effects; the compound baicalein exhibited only inhibitory effects (9)."}

Neo-clerodane diterpenoids also have demonstrated anticancer (24) and antiviral (25) activities.\nIn vitro and in vivo studies of S. barbata have focused mostly on colon, lung, and liver cancer models. In human colon cancer cells, S. barbata induces apoptosis and inhibits cell proliferation and tumor angiogenesis via modulation of Hedgehog, Akt, and p53 pathways, upregulation of proapoptotic Bax/Bcl-2 ratio, decreased cyclin D1 and CDK4 expression, G1/S cell cycle arrest, vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A) inhibition, and promotion of p21 expression (19) (20) (26) (27).\nIn lung tumor models, S. barbata inhibits hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) alpha and VEGF expression (18).

It also plays an important role in thyroid function. Selenium can be obtained from the diet by consuming whole grains, meats, seafood, poultry and nuts, and is sold in supplemental form to boost immune function and for prevention of cardiovascular, rheumatic diseases, and cancer.\n\nSeveral studies have been conducted to determine the role of selenium in reducing the risk of cardiovascular disease but data are inconclusive (23) (28). Supplementation was found to reduce viral load in individuals infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) (19). It was also shown to reduce markers of inflammation and oxidative stress in patients with diabetic nephropathy (41), may improve glucose metabolism, but was not useful in preventing type 2 diabetes and in some cases may increase the risk (20) (30) (42). In another study of asymptomatic older men, selenium alone or in combination with vitamin E was ineffective in preventing dementia (43).\n\nThe importance of selenium in cancer prevention has been documented in epidemiological studies and clinical intervention trials. Data suggest its benefits in preventing gastrointestinal (16) (36) and lung (17) cancers although findings from bladder cancer research are conflicting (26) (38) (44). Selenium supplementation also resulted in reduction of side effects including hair loss, abdominal pain, and loss of appetite in ovarian cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy (15). It was found effective in reducing head and neck lymphedema (12) (14); to help reduce diarrhea associated with radiation therapy (24) in gynecological cancer patients without influencing the effectiveness or long-term survival (39); and may decrease chemotherapy-induced fatigue and nausea in adolescents (40).\n\nHowever, a recent review of randomized controlled trials did not find clear evidence of selenium\u2019s cancer preventive potential (29). The large prevention study SELECT (Selenium and Vitamin E Cancer Prevention Trial) (8), based on previous data indicating that selenium and vitamin E reduced the incidence of prostate cancer, also failed to find evidence of protective effects of selenium. The trial was suspended in January 2009, when initial data analysis showed that selenium, by itself or when combined with vitamin E, did not prevent prostate cancer in healthy men (21). Further, a sub-group analysis failed to find any benefit for prevention of colorectal adenomas (45). In other studies, selenium when used together with soy and Vitamin E, did not prevent prostate cancer progression (27); and when used with lycopene, had no effect on modulating risk of prostate cancer (46). Moreover, results from a cross-sectional analysis of men with prostate cancer indicate that selenium levels may influence the risk of aggressive prostate cancer (22), and supplementation may increase prostate cancer mortality (37).\n\nA chemoprevention trial of selenium in patients with NSCLC (non small-cell lung cancer) was also halted after interim analysis as data did not show any benefit of selenium supplementation; there was an increase in secondary lung cancers in selenium users, although it was statistically insignificant (25). Long-term use of selenium may increase the risk of certain types of skin cancer as well (13).\nAdditional studies indicate no association between dietary selenium intake and thyroid cancer incidence (35), but that it may protect radiation-induced damage to salivary glands in patients with differentiated thyroid cancer (47).", "food_sources": " ", "mechanism_of_action": "Selenium is an essential structural element of the antioxidant enzyme glutathione-peroxidase that converts aggressive oxidation products and intracellular free radicals into less reactive or neutral components (3). Other biological functions of selenium include regulation of thyroid hormone action and regulation of the reduction status of vitamin C (2).\nSelenium has been shown to induce a multi-targeted cell death process characterized by induction of unfolded protein response, ER-stress and occurrence of large cytoplasmic vacuoles, in addition to the formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) (31). However, excessive intake of selenium induces hepatic insulin resistance through opposite regulation of (ROS) (32).\nRecent data show that the effects of dietary selenium on progression of malignant mesothelioma tumors depend on arising cancer cells\u2019 redox metabolism, and the tumors able to convert increased selenium into a stronger reducing capacity actually benefit from increased selenium intake (33). In another study, selenium supplementation was shown to afford protection against adriamycin-induced cardiac dysfunction via restoring ATP-sensitive potassium channels (KATP) expression (34)."}

An orally administered shiitake mycelial extract decreased the incidence of chemotherapy-associated adverse effects in a small study of patients with advanced gastrointestinal cancer (22), and in combination with immunotherapy, improved QOL in cancer patients (48). But a polysaccharide/oligosaccharide complex from shiitake extract failed to show effectiveness in the treatment of prostate cancer (8). More well-designed studies are needed to establish shiitake as a useful adjunct to cancer treatment.", "food_sources": "Fresh or dried whole mushroom", "mechanism_of_action": "Shiitake mushroom supplementation enhanced gut immunity by upregulating interleukin (IL)-23 secretion in a murine model of acute dextran sodium sulfate-colitis (29). Shiitake extracts and the polysaccharide lentinan exerted antiviral effects, by acting on initial replication processes of poliovirus type 1 (PV-1) and bovine herpes virus type 1 (BoHV-1) (31). Another polysaccharide isolated from shiitake exhibited antibacterial effects in mice by increasing T-helper (Th1) cell immunity, resulting in activation of macrophage-mediated immune response (32). The isolated protein lentin exhibited antifungal properties, inhibited proliferation of leukemic cells, and suppressed activity of human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) reverse transcriptase (3). Shiitake consumption in adults altered immune function via increased proliferation of gamma delta-T and NK-T cells, increased secretory immunoglobulin A in saliva, increased IL-1alpha, IL-4, IL-10, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1 levels, and decreased macrophage inflammatory protein-1alpha/chemokine C-C ligand 3 (MIP-1alpha/CCL3) levels (41). A low-molecular-weight lignin from shiitake inhibits hepatitis C virus by binding to viral apolipoprotein E (apoE) before interacting with cell surface heparan sulfate (38).\nEritadenine from shiitake may exert antihypercholemic effects and regulate lipid metabolism by inhibiting S-adenosyl homocysteine hydrolase activity, and both eritadenine and shiitake mushroom supplementation upregulated CYP7A1 mRNA expression which was decreased in hypercholesterolemic mice (39). High doses of shiitake mushroom prevented obesity in rats by increasing plasma triacylglycerol accumulation in the liver (30).\nDried shiitake extract caused apoptosis in human hepatocellular carcinoma (HepG2) cells by mediating caspase-3 and -8 pathways  (21). Inhibition of lung cancer cells by the Latcripin-13 domain isolated from shiitake was shown to be due to apoptotic induction (40). Anticancer effects of the polysaccharide lentinan (1,3 beta-D-glucan) may be due to its ability to suppress cytochrome P450 1A enzymes that are known to metabolize procarcinogens to active forms (2). Polysaccharides SLNT1 and JLNT1 isolated from the mushroom also demonstrated antitumor effects by increasing serum IL-2 levels and TNF-\u03b1 production, and by inducing apoptosis in tumor cells in mice (33)."}

Soy also contains significant amounts of isoflavones \u2014 genistein (4\u2019,5,7-trihydroxyisoflavone), daidzein (4\u2019,7-dihydroxyisoflavone), and glycitein (4\u2019,7-dihydroxy-6-methoxyisoflavone) (1). They are marketed as dietary supplements to treat hot flashes, high cholesterol, and for cancer prevention. Isoflavones exhibit both selective estrogen receptor modulator activity and non-hormonal effects. Studies of soy for menopausal symptoms are inconclusive (2) (3) (4) (5) (6) (7) (8) (9). While some trials indicate slower bone density loss (10) (11) (91), others report no such effects in postmenopausal women (12) (13). But there may be cardiovascular benefits (17), as soy reduced low-density-lipoprotein (LDL) (14) (15) and had beneficial effects on blood pressure in postmenopausal women (16) (97) and healthy adults (90). Genistein improved fasting blood glucose, insulin levels, and insulin resistance (18).\nSoy intake also reduced proteinuria in type 2 diabetic patients with nephropathy (19). However, conflicting data suggest no protective effects against diabetes (20). Other studies of soy did not find benefit for Alzheimer\u2019s disease (92) or for poorly controlled asthma (93), but soy isoflavone supplementation alone or with Vitamin D improved some symptoms and quality of life in patients with irritable bowel disease (94).\nSoy has been investigated for its anticancer effects. Data show that it may reduce risk of prostate (21) (22) (23), lung (24) (80), and endometrial (25) (26) cancers, but increase the risk of bladder cancer (27) and endometrial hyperplasia (28). It may prolong survival among women with lung cancer (81), reduce mortality (89) and breast cancer recurrence regardless of tamoxifen use (42), or prevent breast cancer (29) (30). However, long-term soy supplementation did not affect mammographic density in breast cancer patients or high-risk women (95) and other data suggest adverse effects (31) (32) or that supplementation can stimulate over-expression of breast cancer genes in patients with invasive breast cancer (87). Preclinical findings also suggest that soy consumption may increase metastasis (33), and daidzin-rich extracts can promote ER-positive breast cancer growth (88).\nGenistein, the most estrogenic isoflavone (34), demonstrated antiproliferative effects in multiple cell lines, including breast cancer (ER+/-) (35), prostate cancer (androgen-dependent/-independent) (36), nasopharyngeal carcinoma (37), neuroblastoma, sarcoma, and retinoblastoma cells (36). However, animal studies show that it antagonizes the effects of tamoxifen (38) (39) and promotes tumor progression in advanced prostate cancer (40). Soy supplements may decrease serum PSA levels in prostate cancer patients before (41), but not after (82), prostatectomy. Further research is needed to evaluate the role of genistein in cancer prevention.\nIsoflavone supplementation may reduce side effects associated with chemo- or radiotherapy (43) (44), but when used with vitamin E and selenium, did not prevent prostate cancer progression (45). It was also ineffective in reducing hot flashes in patients with prostate cancer (83). Patients should consult their physicians about the use of soy supplements.", "food_sources": "Raw soybeans, low-fat soy flour, roasted soybeans, dry-roasted soy beans, soy milk, tofu, and soy protein isolate. There are no isoflavones in soy sauce or soy oil.", "mechanism_of_action": "Animal studies suggest that genistein and daidzein can prevent or reduce bone loss in a manner similar to synthetic estrogen due to increased beta versus alpha estrogen receptor (ER) binding (10). Both isoflavones may modulate bone remodeling through ERs by regulating target gene expression (50). Soy may also contribute to maintaining bone density by causing less calcium to be excreted in the urine (35). Isoflavones may inhibit oxidation of LDL and alter hepatic metabolism with enhanced removal of LDL and VLDL by hepatocytes (17). Serum lipids may also be regulated through modified transcription factor and downstream gene expression and by promoting antioxidant enzyme activity (51).\nIn addition, several mechanisms have been proposed for soy\u2019s anticancer effects. Genistein affects microRNA expression-targeted translation inhibitors for multiple proteins implicated in regulating various pathobiological processes (52). It also demonstrated an anti-minichromosome maintenance (MCM) effect, a gene family frequently upregulated in various cancers and considered a promising anticancer drug target (53).\nIn breast cancer cells, genistein acts as an agonist to estrogen receptor (ER)-alpha in ER-alpha-predominant cells, but likely acts as an antiestrogen in cells with ER-beta alone, suggesting therapeutic potential for premenopausal women with ER-alpha-negative/ER-beta-positive tumors (54). However, genistein induces estrogen-dependent MCF-7 tumor cell growth and increases breast cancer-associated aromatase expression/activity, suggesting that soy-based supplements may affect aromatase inhibitor efficacy (55). Genistein is also known to negate tamoxifen\u2019s inhibitory effect on MCF-7 tumor growth and increase expression of estrogen-responsive genes (38). Alternatively, soy isoflavones may reduce breast cancer risk by decreasing endogenous ovarian steroid levels (56). Studies suggest that some benefits ascribed to dietary isoflavones may depend on early life exposure, thereby impacting gene expression at the epigenetic level (47) (48) (49).\nIn prostate tumors, soy protein was shown to reduce androgen receptor expression (57). Both genistein and daidzein affect microRNA regulation (58) and induce decreased methylation of gene promoters, including BRCA1 (59). In tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL)-resistant prostate cancer cells, soy isoflavones enhance TRAIL-mediated apoptosis by engaging apoptotic pathways and regulating NF-\u03baB activity (60) (61). However, in a patient-derived prostate cancer xenograft model, increased proliferation and metastasis in genistein-treated groups were linked to enhanced activities of tyrosine kinases, the epidermal growth factor receptor, and its downstream Src (40). Both genistein and daidzein also act as radiosensitizers for prostate cancer in vitro and in vivo, but pure genistein increased lymph node metastasis, whereas the combination of genistein, daidzein, and glycitein did not. Daidzein may protect against genistein-induced metastasis, and its ability to inhibit cell growth and potentiate radiation appears to be androgen-receptor-independent (62). In addition, soy isoflavones radiosensitized human A549 NSCLC cells, and decreased hemorrhages, inflammation, and fibrosis caused by radiation suggesting protection of normal lung tissue (63)."}

Spilanthes is used to help relieve side effects from cancer treatments such as dry mouth, gum irritation, loss or changes in taste sensation, and to stimulate appetite.\nSpilanthol and acmellonate, compounds derived from this plant, are associated with reduced toothache pain and increased saliva secretion (1).

Taste-activating alkamide compounds that induce a salivary response have also been identified (4). Spilanthol is among the most active alkamides isolated from aerial parts of A. oleracea to demonstrate insecticidal (14) and acaricidal (15) activity. It was also found to significantly inhibit cytochrome P4502E1, but the physiological significance of this inhibition is not clear (17).\nIn animal models, spilanthol isolated from S. acmella reduced inflammatory responses via nuclear factor kappa-B inactivation (6). Potential mechanisms for gastroprotective effects with rhamnogalacturonan, a polysaccharide isolated from A. oleracea, include protectively binding to the mucosal surface, increasing mucus synthesis, scavenging radicals, and diminishing secretions of acid and pepsin (12). Other research suggests that rhamnogalacturonan promotes the restoration of epithelial continuity via epithelial cell proliferation and enhances mucin production to promote gastric ulcer healing (13).\nAn animal study found that an S. acmella ethanolic flower extract, rich in alkylamides, affected male sexual functioning by increasing levels of testosterone, follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), and luteinizing hormone (LH) (5)."}

"Common: Headache, nausea, dry mouth, sleepiness, and gastrointestinal upset (5).\nInfrequent: Photosensitivity (18), neuropathy (29), increased prothrombin time (21).\n  Case reports\nAcute transplant rejection: Two patients with prior heart transplantation due to end-stage ischemic cardiomyopathy who were maintained on immunosuppressive regimens that included cyclosporin experienced transplant rejection directly linked to the use of St. John\u2019s wort. After discontinuation of the supplement, plasma cyclosporin returned to therapeutic values (45). A subsequent report of 45 kidney or liver transplant recipients also describe rejection episodes or declines in trough levels of cyclosporin (average, 49%) linked to ingestion of St. John\u2019s wort. In many cases, these patients did not inform their healthcare team about their ingestion of this supplement (46).\n\nCardiovascular collapse: Hypotension without anaphylactic symptoms occurred shortly after induction of general anesthesia was potentially linked to long-term use of St. John\u2019s wort in a patient (47).\n\nSevere drug-induced acute hepatitis: A 61-year-old woman with chronic hepatitis C receiving pegylated interferon \u03b1 obtained undetectable qualitative hepatitis C virus that persisted after treatment suspension. The patient revealed use of St. John\u2019s wort for depressed mood in the preceding 6 weeks. She was hospitalized after continued worsening of liver function tests and tested positive for antinuclear antibodies. Elevated levels slowly declined after methylprednisolone treatment, but a new flare occurred with steroid tapering. Liver function tests returned to baseline levels after 6 months of prednisone treatment. It was determined the combination of pegylated interferon \u03b1 and St. John\u2019s wort resulted in severe acute hepatitis in this patient (48).\n\nMania: Occurred in 3 patients with underlying bipolar disorder but resolved promptly in 2 patients following discontinuation while the third experienced persistent agitation for several months (36).\n\nSerotonin syndrome: Hypertension, diaphoresis, agitation, dizziness, and weakness with acute onset occurred in 1 patient following 10 days of St. John\u2019s wort, but resolved following supportive care and supplement discontinuation (49). In a case series, five elderly patients who combined prescription antidepressants with St. John\u2019s wort were clinically diagnosed with central serotonergic syndrome (44).\n\nErythroderma: Developed 4 days after initiation of St. John\u2019s wort affecting both light-exposed and non light-exposed areas of skin, and resolved after 5 weeks with concomitant oral steroids (50).\n\nHypericin-induced radiation recall dermatitis: A 65-year-old man with completely resected squamous cell carcinoma of the epiglottis who received adjuvant locoregional radiotherapy (RT) developed unusual intensive skin reactions during treatment. The skin was completely bland at follow-up, but half a year later the previously irradiated skin became erythematous. The patient took hypericin for depressive mood during and months after RT without informing the physician. Local application of a steroid cream diminished symptoms that would return after the end of steroid therapy. Symptoms eventually disappeared with the discontinuation of hypericin (40).\n\nPhotosensitivity reactions: Three cases of photosensitivity reactions occurred in individuals who used topical and/or oral St. John\u2019s wort preparations prior to sun exposure or undergoing phototherapy (18). Although 2 of the 3 cases were complicated by pre-existing disease and therapy, St. John\u2019s wort photosensitivity was still the identified cause, and in the patient with pre-existing disease did not entirely resolve.\n\nSubacute toxic neuropathy: A 35-year-old woman who took St. John\u2019s Wort for mild depression developed stinging pain on sun-exposed areas after 4 weeks which worsened during and after sun exposure. Pain was provoked by light touch or air movement. Symptoms began to improve 3 weeks after St. John\u2019s wort was withdrawn, and disappeared after 2 months (29).\n\nSexual dysfunction: Decreased sexual libido was normalized following discontinuation of St. John\u2019s wort (51).\n\nWithdrawal syndrome: Nausea, anorexia, dry retching, dizziness, dry mouth, thirst, cold chills, and extreme fatigue occurred in a patient within 24 hours of stopping intake of St. John\u2019s wort after 32 days of treatment (52).\n\nProlonged facial dystonia: Reported in a 58-year-old Caucasian woman following use of bupropion along with St. John\u2019s wort (53).", "annotated_ADR": [{"term": "Headache", "id": "10019211", "source_db": "meddra", "original_string": "HEADACHE"}, {"term": "Nausea", "id": "10028813", "source_db": "meddra", "original_string":

The flowering tops are reputed for their medicinal properties and the herb has a centuries-long history as a remedy for headaches, kidney problems, and nerve disorders. It was also used by Native Americans for wound healing, snakebites, and diarrhea. Today, St. John\u2019s wort is used in several European countries as an antidepressant, and to treat anxiety, sleep and seasonal affective disorder. It is marketed as a dietary supplement in the U.S. for depression and other psychological symptoms.\nSt. John\u2019s wort is one of the most extensively studied herbs, with active constituents hyperforin and hypericin being the focus of most research. Lab studies show that St. John\u2019s wort has neuroprotective properties (1) and may relieve neuropathic pain (2). Clinical studies suggest St. John\u2019s wort may be as effective as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) such as paroxetine (3), fluoxetine (4) (5) and citalopram (6) (7) for mild to moderate depression; it was also shown to be a cost-effective alternative to generic antidepressants (75). Reductions in depression were also sustained with continued use (8). However, data are inconsistent when all types of depression are analyzed (9) (10) and some randomized trials have found St. John\u2019s wort ineffective for both major (11) and minor depression (12). A few studies also indicate efficacy of St. John\u2019s wort in the management of premenstrual syndrome (13), and vasomotor symptoms in peri- and postmenopausal women (14), but failed to show any benefit for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder in children and adolescents (15) and in individuals with stomatodynia (16). Another study suggests that St. John\u2019s wort may enhance the effect of clopidogrel in patients who have undergone percutaneous coronary intervention (17) but more studies are needed.\nSt. John\u2019s wort has many documented interactions with conventional drugs through the induction of cytochrome P450 (CYP450) enzymes resulting in reduced efficacy or treatment failure, as well as several associated adverse effects. Its use may also cause photosensitivity (18) and has been associated with increased risk of cataracts (19) (20). Therefore, patients should speak with their physician or pharmacist before using this product.", "food_sources": " ", "mechanism_of_action": "In vitro studies have shown hypericum to inhibit serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine reuptake by neurons (22) (23). Although earlier data suggested monoamine oxidase inhibition, further investigation demonstrated this inhibition to be insignificant in vivo (24). More recently hyperforin, the main constituent associated with serotonin reuptake inhibition, was shown to activate transient receptor potential C6 channels in vitro inducing neurite outgrowth and possibly influencing monoamine uptake (25), and to stimulate the development and function of oligodendrocytes (26). Hypericin suppresses voltage-dependent calcium channel and mitogen-activated protein kinase activity and evokes glutamate release, adding further clues to its function in the brain (27). Hypericin-induced phototoxicity appears to be oxygen-dependent and may involve intracellular pH reduction or mediation by the TNF-related apoptosis inducing ligand receptor system (28). Incidental reporting also suggests that photoactivated hypericin can cause the demyelination of cutaneous axons (29).\nMechanisms by which St. John\u2019s wort induces or modulates different enzymes, altering the pharmacokinetics of corresponding drug substrates, continue to be evaluated. Hyperforin induces CYP 3A4 through activation of the pregnane X receptor (30) and St. John\u2019s wort extract modulates UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (31) and P-glycoprotein (P-gp) activity via protein kinase C (PKC) (32). Analgesic and CNS activity may be due to its bioflavonoid content (21) as well as through inhibition of PKC isoforms and their phosphorylation (2).\nThe enolized beta-dicarbonyl system contained in hyperforin may play a central role in its antiangiogenic activity, but the chemical and metabolic instability of hyperforin itself has led to the search for more stable derivatives (33). In animal models, hyperforin and its stabilized derivative aristoforin suppress lymphatic endothelial cell growth and lymphangiogenesis by inducing cell cycle arrest or apoptosis (34). Hyperforin also reversed P-gp and breast cancer resistance protein activity in human myeloid leukemia cell lines (35)."}

It is used in traditional Chinese and Indian medicine systems for chest pain, heart-related problems, dizziness, skin and eye disorders, to expel kidney stones, and as a diuretic and tonic. It is also marketed as a dietary supplement to enhance sexual function (25) and for body building (26) (27).\nPreliminary studies indicate that tribulus has analgesic (1), antihypertensive (2) (3), anti-inflammatory (4) (28), antiedematous (28), antioxidant (5) (6), diuretic (7), hypoglycemic (8), antibacterial (9), antifungal (9) (10), cardioprotective (29), and anticancer properties (11) (12) (15).\nIn vitro studies found that saponins in tribulus inhibit platelet aggregation (30). In animal models of chronic mild stress tribulus saponins produced antidepressive effects (31). In diabetic neuropathic pain models, a standardized tribulus extract was found to be comparable to the drug Pregabalin, with significant increases in pain threshold responses (32).\nTribulus has been shown to increase sperm production (13), but its effects on testosterone levels are mixed (14) (16). In human studies, testosterone increases only occurred when tribulus was part of a combined supplement therapy, making it difficult to determine its contribution to this effect (25). In a randomized double-blind study to evaluate effects on erectile dysfunction and serum total testosterone, tribulus was not more effective than placebo (33). A pilot study evaluating tribulus in men with partial androgen deficiency showed significant differences in testosterone levels and erectile function, but no significant differences in levels of luteinizing hormone (34). In women, however, two small studies indicate improvements in sexual dysfunction (35) (36). Larger randomized controlled trials are needed to confirm these results. A tribulus extract used alone did not not improve androgenic status or physical performance among athletes (26) (37).\nSaponins in tribulus have shown activity against in breast (38) and prostate cancer cells (39), and may protect against UVB-induced carcinogenesis (40). In animal models, tribulus resulted in a significant reduction in tumor incidence, tumor burden, and cumulative number of papillomas (19), and relieved cisplatin-induced renal toxicity (41).\nDue to its purported hormonal activities, prostate cancer patients should avoid this product.", "food_sources": " ", "mechanism_of_action": "In vitro, cinnamic amides in tribulus fruits inhibit papain-like protease (PLpro), an essential proteolytic enzyme which plays a critical role in virus-mediated RNA replication (42). Di-p-coumaroylquinic acid derivatives in tribulus are associated with its antioxidant effects (43).\nAphrodisiac effects may be associated with the constituent protodioscin, which leads to an increase in some sex hormones (44). Erectogenic effects may also occur via conversion of protodioscin to DHEA (36) or by concentration-dependent relaxation of the corpus cavernosum (CC) via reactions in the nitric oxide (NO)/NO synthase pathway and CC endothelium (45) (25). The NO release effect may explain observed physiological responses to tribulus supplementation, independent of testosterone level (25). In a study conducted in rats with ovarian cysts, tribulus extract showed a luteinizing effect related to gonadotropin-like activity (20).\nSaponins exhibit cytotoxic and antihyperlipidemic effects (42). They may protect against atherosclerosis by suppressing angiotensin II-induced vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation via inhibition of intracellular ROS production, calcium ion mobilization, pkc-\u03b1 expression, ERK1/2 phosphorylation, and proto-oncogene expression (46). In ischemic cells, polyphenol-mediated antioxidant activity with tribulus extract resulted in significant suppression of LDH release, ROS generation, and superoxide production (29).\nIn animal models, tribulus exerts a protective effect in diabetic rats by inhibiting oxidative stress (6) and lowering levels of glycosylated hemoglobin and cholesterols (8). In diabetic neuropathic pain models, tribulus modulates oxidative stress and inflammatory cytokine release in a dose-dependent manner via increases in superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione peroxidase, and reduced glutathione and lipid peroxide levels (32). In chronic mild stress models, the attenuation of serum corticotropin-releasing factor and cortisol levels by tribulus saponins suggest normalization of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis hyperactivity (31). Antihypertensive effects occur via arterial smooth muscle relaxation, NO release, and membrane hyperpolarization (3). An aqueous extract also demonstrated angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE)-inhibition activity (2) that may help lower blood pressure. Phenolic acids such as chlorogenic acid, caffeic acid and 4-hydroxybenzoic acid may be responsible for reputed cardioprotective properties (29).\nTribulus extracts induce apoptosis and suppress cancer cell proliferation by activating caspase 3, dephosphorylating extracellular signal-related kinase (ERK) 1 and 2 (15), and by inhibiting nuclear factor (NF-kappa B) signaling (12). Saponins from tribulus inhibit multiple-drug resistance of cancer cells (11). In breast carcinoma cell lines, a saponin extract changed mRNA levels of CXCR4, CCR7 and BCL2 genes (38). In models of human prostate cancer, antitumor and antiangiogenic activities are attributed to cell-cycle arrest and apoptotic induction not involving the caspase pathway (39). Saponins also act as a modulator of apoptosis: in normal human keratinocytes, saponins attenuate UVB-induced programmed cell death through inhibition of intrinsic apoptotic pathway, but enhance apoptotic response in squamous cell carcinomas (40). The photoprotective effect of saponins is attributed to enhanced NER gene expression and inhibition of UVB-mediated NF-kappaB activation (40). In animal models, a hydroalcoholic extract of tribulus relieved cisplatin-induced renal toxicity, perhaps via diuretic effects that increase drug excretion, scavenging free radicals via increase in antioxidant enzymes, suppressing inflammatory agents, and acting on organic cation transporter 2 (OCT2) proteins (41).\nTribulus extract was shown to limit formation of calcium oxalate and calcium hydrogen phosphate dihydrate crystals (21) (22), mineral compounds that can cause kidney stones.\nConsumption of tribulus causes motor neuron adverse effects in animals by affecting the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptors (18). The steroidal saponin diosgenin is thought to be responsible for hepatotoxic effects associated with tribulus (27)."}

The rhizome is used as a spice in regional cuisines, and as a coloring agent in food and cosmetics for its yellow-orange color. It is also used in traditional medicine for improving circulation and digestion. Turmeric extracts are marketed as dietary supplements to improve memory, for arthritis, and for cancer prevention.\nThe active constituents are turmerone oil and water-soluble curcuminoids, among which curcumin has been the focus of research. In vitro studies suggest that curcumin acts as a weak phytoestrogen (1), and exhibits neuroprotective (2), choleretic (3), anti-inflammatory (4), immunomodulatory (5), anti-proliferative (3), and chemopreventive effects (6) (7) (8). Curcumin, its analogs, and liposomal formulations have also produced chemosensitizing (9) (10) (11) and radiosensitizing effects (12) (13).\nTurmeric and its active constituents have been investigated for their therapeutic activities in humans. A clinical trial suggests it may be effective against major depressive disorder  (62). Data from an epidemiological study suggest improved cognitive performance in elderly Asians who consume turmeric in the form of curry powder (14); however, there were no benefits from curcumin supplementation in patients with Alzheimer\u2019s disease (15). Turmeric may help alleviate symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome  (16) or quiescent ulcerative colitis (17), but in a double-blind randomized trial of patients with familial adenomatous polyposis, there was no reduction in lower intestinal tract adenomas with long-term use of curcumin versus placebo  (70).\nTurmeric extract was found to be safe and equally effective as a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug for the treatment of osteoarthritis of the knee (18). Whether curcumin supplementation increases cholesterol levels is unclear, as study results are mixed (19) (20). In a study of postmenopausal women, consumption of curcumin along with aerobic exercise training were shown to improve vascular endothelial function (61). Findings of a systematic review suggest that turmeric or curcumin supplementation may benefit patients with non alcoholic fatty liver disease by positively affecting serum concentrations of liver enzymes (75).\nTurmeric has also been studied in cancer patients. Oral curcumin administered to colorectal cancer patients during the pre-surgery waiting period improved cachexia and the general health of patients (21). In a phase II trial of oral curcumin in patients with advanced pancreatic cancer, no treatment-related toxic effects were observed, and clinically relevant biological activity was seen in two patients despite limited absorption (22). Other preliminary results suggest turmeric during capecitabine treatment may reduce rates of hand-foot syndrome  (71). In another study, supplementation with a blend of green tea, pomegranate, broccoli and curcumin resulted in a reduction in the rate of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) increase among men with prostate cancer following a PSA relapse post-radical treatment (65).\nIn early phase studies, a combination of curcumin and docetaxel was shown to be safe (23). Curcumin with gemcitabine was also found to be safe and feasible for further study (24) (25), but a high dose of curcumin must be used to achieve systemic effect (23) (25). A dose-finding trial of a curcumin extract to determine safety and efficacy for patients with metastatic disease undergoing standard FOLFOX chemotherapy is currently underway (72). \nPreliminary data suggest effectiveness of a topical turmeric-based cream for reduction of radiotherapy-induced dermatitis in patients with head and neck cancer (64); and of topical application of turmeric or curcumin for controlling signs and symptoms of oral mucositis (76).\nCurcumin is known to interfere with cytochrome P450 enzymes (26) (27) and may interact with chemotherapy drugs like cyclophosphamide and doxorubicin (28). Overall, the development of turmeric for clinical use needs further investigation due to its inherent poor absorption, rapid metabolism, complex mechanistic profile, and largely preclinical data.", "food_sources": "Turmeric is a major ingredient in curry powder, a spice commonly found in South Asian food.", "mechanism_of_action": "The hepatoprotective effects of curcumin, the most researched active constituent in turmeric, may occur via MMP-13 induction and TGF-alpha inhibition (30), as well as anti-apoptotic/anti-necrotic mechanisms (31). However, it has also been shown to inhibit cell-cycle progression during normal liver regeneration (3).\nA meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials revealed that curcumin is effective in decreasing the concentration of tumor necrosis factor-alpha, a key mediator in many inflammatory diseases (68). In vitro and animal studies of lung models point to antiproliferative and modulatory mechanisms involving inhibition of the signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 Stat3 pathway (32), matrix metalloproteinase, and vascular endothelial growth factor (33); caspase- and mitochondria-dependent apoptosis (34) (35); and cyclin-dependent kinase downregulation (35). Curcumin also appears to have synergistic effects with isoflavones, suppressing the prostate-specific antigen (PSA) production in prostate cells through anti-androgen effects (36).\n\nStudies done on breast cancer show that curcumin may inhibit chemotherapy-induced apoptosis via inhibition of the c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK) pathway and generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) (28). Data also suggest that curcumin induces apoptosis in human colon cancer cells independent of p21 expression (39). Curcumin\u2019s antitumor actions appear to be due to its interactions with arachidonate metabolism and its in vivo antiangiogenic properties (14). Another possible chemopreventive mechanism may be via binding and activating the vitamin D receptor (VDR), thereby protecting the small intestine and colon where VDRs are expressed and vitamin D is known to serve an anticancer function (38). Curcumin also inhibited growth of uterine leiomyosarcoma cells by targeting the AKT-mTOR (RAC-alpha serine-threonine-protein kinase; mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) pathway (37). Curcumin may inhibit bladder cancer progression by downregulating the expression of beta-catenin, high levels of which are associated with several cancers (69).\nAnother study found that CRM1, an important nuclear exportin, is a cellular target of curcumin; and that the inhibition of nuclear traffic by curcumin may be responsible for its many biological effects (63)."}

Valerian constituents can also bind to various neurotransmitter receptors implicated in circadian rhythms and anxiety such as serotonin receptors (35). In vitro and animal models indicate that anxiolytic activity is due to valerenic acid (VA) which could be inhibited by VA derivatives such as hydroxy-VA that do not modulate gamma-aminobutyric acid type A (GABAA) receptors (36). VA in animals inhibits the enzyme system responsible for central catabolism of GABA, increasing GABA concentration and decreasing CNS activity, and direct binding of this constituent to GABA-receptors has been demonstrated (37). VA interaction with the GABAAergic system has been noted to act in a manner similar to that of benzodiazepines (6). Sesquiterpenes and valepotriates were identified as having varying levels of antidepressant activity (7) (38). Chronic treatment of rodents with valepotriate-rich extract increased norepinephrine and dopamine levels (38). Valerian exhibits antispasmodic and hypotensive effects via potassium channel (KATP) activation, which may be useful in gastrointestinal and cardiovascular disorders (5). Valerian also exhibited a protective effect against vasopressin-induced coronary spasm and pressor response, suggesting coronary and systemic vasodilation (4).\nIn healthy volunteers, valerian was found to modulate intracortical facilitatory circuits (55). Valerian iridoids may have choleretic activity and this may increase the risk of gallstone formation, and therefore explain the increased risk for development of acute pancreatitis (27)."}

Vinpocetine helps improve spatial memory in rats through its ability to prevent neuronal damage and to favorably modulate cholinergic function (18). It demonstrated antiepileptic effects by suppressing abnormal neuronal excitability through the regulation of sodium channels and release of dopamine in the striatal nerve endings (5) (6) (7). Vinpocetine antagonizes platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)-induced extracellular matrix synthesis, suppresses intracellular reactive oxidative species (ROS) production, and inhibits extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) 1/2 activation and vascular smooth muscle cell growth (4). Anti-atherogenic effects occur through inhibition of monocyte adhesion, oxidative stress, and inflammatory responses mediated by protein kinase B (Akt)/nuclear factor kappa B (NF-\u0138B)-dependent pathways (3). Vinpocetine also demonstrates anti-inflammatory effects by inhibiting tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-\u03b1)-induced NF-\u03baB activities (19) as well as Akt and STAT3 activation (15).

It is essential for normal nerve function, DNA synthesis, hematopoiesis, fatty acid metabolism, and amino acid synthesis in the mitochondria. It also plays an important role in homocysteine metabolism. Vitamin B12 is abundant in diets that include meat and dairy products, although deficiency can occur in those with mal-absorption syndromes (2), take medications for gastric disorders (3) (4), for conditions associated with insulin resistance (5), or in those who follow a strict vegetarian diet (6). B12 deficiency is also more common among the elderly (7). Lack of B12 can lead to a wide variety of hematologic, neurologic, and psychiatric disorders, may increase the risk of cardiovascular disease (8), and cause pseudo-thrombotic microangiopathy following gastrectomy (55). Vitamin B12 is often included in vitamin products used to reduce homocysteine, which is associated with cardiovascular diseases.\nHigh dietary intakes of B vitamins including B12 have been associated with a decreased risk for cataracts (36). However, combined supplementation with B12, B6, and folic acid may increase the risk of cataract extraction (37).\nAlthough low serum B12 levels have been associated with increased bone turnover and fracture risk (9), long-term B12 and folic acid supplementation did not improve bone mineral density (38), or reduce osteoporotic fracture incidence in elderly individuals with elevated plasma homocysteine levels (39).\nRepletion of vitamin B12 may improve response in patients resistant to antidepressants (10); and in older adults with major depression, long-term supplementation with a combination of B12, B6, and folic acid enhanced antidepressant treatment efficacy (40). However, among middle-age and older women, such combined supplementation did not reduce depression risk compared with placebo, despite significant reductions in homocysteine levels (41).\nHomocysteine-lowering therapy may have some cardiovascular benefits following coronary interventions (11), but does not appear to lower the risk of further cardiovascular events including stroke (12) (13) (14). In addition, increased risk of in-stent restenosis with such treatment has been reported in patients after coronary stenting (15). In a large Dutch study known as the B-PROOF trial, 2 years of B12 and folic acid supplementation in hyper-homocysteinemic elderly patients also had no effect on arterial stiffness and atherosclerosis (42). However, in a long-term field study of individuals residing in India at high altitude, B12 and folic acid supplementation reduced the incidence of thrombosis (43). And, conclusions of a meta analysis indicate moderate to low evidence for preventive benefits of folic acid and B-vitamins for stroke (61).\nIn other studies, B12 as part of homocysteine-lowering therapy or B12 repletion therapy (45), did not improve cognitive function (16) (17) (18) (19) (56), even though low-normal B12 concentrations are associated with poorer memory performance (46). This was further echoed in secondary data from the B-PROOF study which showed improving homocysteine levels does not improve cognitive outcomes (47), although the intervention may positively affect gait and physical performance in the elderly (48). Additional data show an association between maternal B12 supplementation during pregnancy with higher expressive language scores in children (57).\nAnd, combination of folic acid and vitamin B12 supplements decreased serum homocysteine levels and improved anemia in patients with multiple sclerosis (58); vitamin B12 improved the quality of life patients with postherpetic neuralgia, and may help reduce analgesic use (59); as well as methylcobalamin, an analogue of vitamin B12, was reported useful in increasing vitamin B12 levels in patients with peripheral neuropathy (60).\nIncreased intake of B12, folate and B6 may lower the risk of breast (20) (21) (22) and cervical (23) cancers, but not lung cancer (24). In fact, long-term use of vitamin B12 supplement is associated with increased risk of lung cancer, especially in male smokers (53). Another large study did not find an effect with this combination on overall risk of invasive cancer or breast cancer (25). However, data from a Norwegian study suggest higher cancer incidence and mortality in patients with ischemic heart disease following B12 and folic acid supplementation (26), although these effects appear to be mediated by folic acid. The combination may also increase the risk of colorectal cancer (54). But supplementation may help reduce pain and improve quality of life in patients with musculoskeletal symptoms associated with aromatase inhibitor use (62). Dietary intake of folate and B12 during pregnancy has been associated with a lower risk for acute lymphoblastic leukemia in children (49). Further studies are needed to confirm these findings.\nIntramuscular B12 injections and oral folic acid reduce toxicity of pemetrexed chemotherapy in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (27), and may also help to improve treatment efficacy (28) (29), but oral administration of vitamin B12 did not have similar effects (50). A large Danish population study identified a correlation between high plasma B12 levels and elevated risk of hematological, smoking-related, and alcohol-related cancers (51); and cancer patients with elevated B12 levels had higher mortality than those with normal values (52). However, such increases are probably due to changes in cobalamin metabolism caused by cancer. It does not suggest that B12 supplementation can cause cancer.", "food_sources": ["Meat", "Poultry", "Fish", "Shellfish", "Dairy", "Fortified cereals"], "mechanism_of_action": "Vitamin B12 is involved in the transfer of methyl groups, and in methylation reactions essential for the synthesis of phospholipids and neurotransmitters in the central nervous system. It is also required for synthesis of nucleic acid, notably DNA, the metabolism of fatty acids and amino acids in the mitochondria, and in delivering SAMe, the universal methyl donor (16) (30). In humans, two enzymatic reactions dependent on B12 are produced and activated in separate cellular compartments: methylcobalamin in the cytosol and adenosylcobalamin in the mitochondria (1). As a coenzyme in methyl transfer reactions, B12 converts homocysteine to methionine, and participates in L-methylmalonyl-coenzyme A (CoA) conversion to succinyl-CoA (8). In the first enzyme reaction, methylcobalamin is used to recycle the folate cofactor 5-methyltetrahydrofolate to tetrahydrofolate thereby allowing the folate cofactor to participate in a cycle involving the biosynthesis of purines and pyrimidines. During this reaction, homocysteine is converted to methionine yielding the methyl groups required for methylation that is essential in biosynthesis (31).\nWhen used with pemetrexed, B12/folic acid therapy further increases sub-G1 populations in human adenocarcinoma and large-cell carcinoma cell lines, independent of p53 status (28)."}

Although plants and microorganisms can synthesize B6 on their own, humans must acquire it from dietary sources. Because vitamin B6 is abundant in meats, fish, poultry, shellfish, leafy green vegetables, legumes, fruits, and whole grains, deficiencies are rare. For example, patients taking the antituberculosis drug isoniazide need to take vitamin B6 to prevent drug-induced peripheral neuropathy. Patients may use supplemental B6 to treat symptoms related to heart disease, hypertension, morning sickness, peripheral neuropathies, carpal tunnel syndrome, and diabetes.\nPreclinical studies show that systemic administration of certain B vitamins including B6 has neuroprotective, antihypertensive (2), antinociceptive (3), and antitumor effects (4). In humans, higher B6 intake may lower serum homocysteine concentrations (5), but did not reduce the risk of developing type 2 diabetes (6). High dietary intakes of folate and B6 have been associated with reduced risk of mortality from stroke, coronary heart disease, and heart failure (7). Vitamin B6 supplementation did not improve cognition in older adults (8) and was not more effective than placebo for carpal tunnel syndrome (9). There is also limited evidence of its effect on asthma susceptibility or established disease (10). Data on its use for premenstrual syndrome is mixed (11), and evidence is limited and weak for the prevention of pregnancy-related nausea (12) (13).\nSome studies suggest a beneficial role for vitamin B6 in preventing colorectal cancer (14) (15) (16), and lower intake of dietary vitamin B6 is associated with increased risk of gastric adenocarcinoma (17) and pancreatic cancer (18). However, conclusions from the Women\u2019s Health Study indicate that supplementation with vitamins B6, B12, and folate did not decrease breast cancer risk (19), nor did it have an effect on overall risk of invasive cancer or breast cancer (20) (21). Long-term vitamin B6 supplement intake is associated with increased risk of lung cancer, especially in male smokers (46). Vitamin B6 administration is ineffective in preventing chemotherapy-associated hand-foot syndrome (HFS; also known as palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia [PPE]) (22) (23) (24) (25), with limited evidence suggesting that higher doses might be needed (26). In one study, it did reduce the need for capecitabine dose modifications and incidence of severe HFS, but did not positively impact chemotherapy effects (27). A multi-arm trial to evaluate therapies including high-dose B6 for peripheral neuropathy did not find it more effective than placebo (28).\nHigh B6 intakes can have toxic effects including sensory and motor neuropathies, and some case reports of neurotoxicity have not been reversible (29). B6 levels can also be elevated due to environmental exposures or genetic defects (1).", "food_sources": "Meats, fish, shellfish, poultry, leafy green vegetables, legumes, fruits, and whole grains (5) (30) (31)", "mechanism_of_action": "Vitamin B6 is a coenzyme in the folate metabolism pathway. Its phosphorylated metabolites are involved in amino acid metabolism, the transsulfuration pathway of homocysteine to cysteine, and glycogen phosphorylase activity which mobilizes glucose from glycogen (32). It is a cofactor along with cystathionine b synthase and cystathionase to produce cysteine and glutathione from their precursor homocysteine (33). Pyridoxal phosphate (PLP) is the major coenzyme form, the most abundant in animal tissue, and the cofactor for over 100 enzymes used in amino acid metabolism, including aminotransferases, decarboxylases, racemases, and dehydrases. It also facilitates mobilization of glucose units from glycogen via glycogen phosphorylase (32). PLP is also the active antiemetic form of B6, of which pyridoxine and pyridoxal have been identified as prodrugs (45).\nIn animal models, an excess-pyridoxine diet actively influenced cell-mediated immunity via enhanced IFN-\u03b3 production and Th1-polarization (34). In several cancer cell lines, B6 contributed to increased p21 gene expression via p53 activation (4). Proposed mechanisms for an inverse relationship of B6 intake and serum PLP with cancer risk include: 1) its participation in one-carbon metabolism that is essential for DNA synthesis, repair, and methylation; 2) the high uracil and chromosome breaks caused by B6 deficiency which may interfere with these processes leading to aberrant gene expression, DNA instability, and eventual disease; and 3) possible cancer-suppression effects through reductions in cell proliferation, angiogenesis, oxidative stress, inflammation, and nitric oxide synthesis (16) (21).\nAt the same time, because PLP is the metabolically active form of B6, it is thought to be responsible for instances of vitamin B6 toxicity (29). High circulating pyridoxine levels may have direct toxic effects on peripheral sensory ganglia neurons in the lower blood\u2013nerve barrier, whereas the blood\u2013brain barrier protects neurons in those regions from higher levels (35). The negative impact of B6 upon levels of other B vitamins appears to be dose-dependent and occur with chronic exposure (29)."}

"scientific_name": "Ascorbic Acid, C6H8O6", "warnings": " ", "clinical_summary": "Vitamin C, also known as ascorbic acid, exists as either ascorbic acid or ascorbate. It is a water-soluble vitamin that is found in many fresh fruits and vegetables, and is essential for a variety of physiologic functions including formation of collagen and catecholamines, and carnitine and peptide synthesis (1). It is not synthesized in the human body, and deficiency can cause scurvy. Oral vitamin C is consumed as an antioxidant supplement for immune protection against colds and the flu, wound healing, cardiovascular health, and cancer prevention. High-dose intravenous (IV) vitamin C is being studied as a cancer treatment.\nThe purported effects of vitamin C have been examined in many clinical and epidemiologic studies. Regular intake of vitamin C supplements may reduce duration and severity of the common cold. However, the effect is minimal except in people exposed to acute severe physical stress (2). Vitamin C is believed to promote cardiovascular health but findings are inconsistent. Previous studies suggest that intake of dietary vitamin C, not supplements, may reduce the risk of coronary heart diseases (3). However, two large-scale randomized trials did not find any benefits (4) (5). Further, supplementation with vitamins C and E increased risk of mortality and nonfatal myocardial infarction in patients with coronary artery disease (6). Data on vitamin C\u2019s effect in reducing blood pressure are also conflicting (7) (8).\nVitamin C supplementation may reduce blood glucose and lipids in type 2 diabetes patients (9). It also decreases urinary infection rates in pregnant women (10); lowers incidence of organ failure and shortens ICU stay after surgery (11); and protects against Alzheimer\u2019s disease (12) (13). Vitamin C can help eradicate H. pylori infection when added to a standard medication regimen (14) and supplementation may potentiate treatment efficacy in some patients with thalassemia (68). However, antioxidants including vitamin C do not prevent or slow the progression of age-related cataracts (15) or macular degeneration (16). Vitamin C may also reduce endurance training efficiency (17).\nData do not support prophylactic vitamin C to lower postoperative atrial fibrillation incidence among cardiac surgery patients (69) (70), but one study reported a reduction in other postsurgical side effects (71). In adults undergoing oral surgery, vitamin C reduced postoperative pain without increased side-effects in one study (72).\nThe role of vitamin C in cancer prevention is unclear. Studies indicate that it reduces oxidative stress (18). High plasma levels of vitamin C are associated with lower gastrointestinal cancer incidence probably due to its protective effects against dietary carcinogenic nitroso compounds (19). Intake of vitamins A, C, or E reduced risk of cervical cancer (20), but they do not prevent gastrointestinal (21), prostate (22), lung cancers (23) , or other cancer incidences, or affect cancer mortality (24) (73). Further, vitamin C supplementation is associated with increased risk of liver cancer, although this effect is not observed with vitamin C from dietary sources (25).\nHigh-dose vitamin C has been long been used as an alternative cancer treatment (26) based on the hypothesis that the formation of new collagen resists malignant infiltration (27). Early reports using parenteral plus oral ascorbic acid showed promising results (28), but subsequent randomized placebo-controlled trials in advanced cancer patients using 10 g per day of oral vitamin C did not demonstrate significant benefits (29) (30). This lack of effect is explained by the finding of a pharmacokinetic study that ascorbic acid can only reach a limited plasma concentration through oral administration (31). A higher pharmacologic concentration, achieved only via intravenous injection, had selective cytotoxic effects on cancer cell lines (32) (33). Ascorbic acid is postulated to act as a carrier of hydrogen peroxide to the extracelluar fluid (32) where it generates free radicals against tumor cells (33). High-dose IV ascorbic acid up to 1.5 g /kg/day (34), or used with chemotherapy (74) appears to be well-tolerated. It may improve the quality of life of terminal cancer patients (35), and reduce chemotherapy-associated toxicity (67). This led to a renewed interest in studying high-dose IV vitamin C as an anticancer treatment (34) (36). However, it should be regarded as an investigational drug and used only in a clinical trial setting.\nThere are conflicting theories against the use of vitamin C supplements during chemotherapy. In vitro and animal studies found that cancer cells preferentially uptake vitamin C (37) and render some chemotherapy drugs less effective (38). Also, a major concern surrounding the use of antioxidants such as vitamin C is that they can interfere with the actions of chemotherapy and radiation therapy that rely on the production of reactive oxygen species for their cytotoxic activities (39). However, a clinical study showed that ascorbic acid does not reduce the therapeutic effects of paclitaxel and carboplatin (40). Another study found an increase in chemotherapy-associated adverse effects with inadequate intake of vitamin C in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (41). In other preliminary studies, short-term vitamin C plus E supplementation during radiotherapy had a protective effect against xerostomia for patients with head and neck cancer (75), and a combination of vitamins C, E, and selenium lessened radioiodine-induced oxidative stress in thyroid cancer patients (76).\nAdverse effects from vitamin C are rare but there are reports of gastrointestinal upset, kidney stone formation (42) , and hemolytic anemia in patients with G6PDH deficiency (43) (44). Patients with a history of oxalate kidney stones, renal insufficiency, hematochromatosis, or those undergoing chemotherapy should consult their physicians before taking vitamin C supplements.", "food_sources": "Citrus fruits, fresh vegetables, berries, melons", "mechanism_of_action": "Vitamin C is essential for the formation and polymerization of collagen; therefore deficiency results in scurvy and poor wound healing (1). Vitamin C also inhibits hyaluronidase leading to the hypothesis that it can prevent cancer metastasis by strengthening the buildup and preventing the breakdown of collagen (45).\nAscorbic acid acts as an antioxidant to protect against oxidative damage from free radicals (46). It inactivates nitric oxide and improves endothelium-dependent vasodilation (47), and acts via different mechanisms depending on its plasma concentration. Plasma concentrations <0.1mM are achieved through oral intake of dietary or supplemental forms. At pharmacologic plasma concentrations of 0.3 - 20mM via intravenous injection, ascorbic acid is oxidized to an ascorbate radical which acts as a prodrug for hydrogen peroxide formation within interstitial fluids (33). This induces DNA damage and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) depletion, and triggers ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM)/adenosine monophosphate\u2013activated protein kinase (AMPK) and inhibition of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) in cancer cells (67).\nOther preclinical studies suggest that ascorbate can regulate hematopoietic stem cell function and leukemogenesis (77). In leukemia cells, vitamin C compensated for Tet2 mutations to restore normal function (78). In non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and glioblastoma (GBM) cells, pharmacological ascorbate selectively sensitized these cells (79). Ascorbate decreases colon cancer cell proliferation by downregulating specificity proteins (Sp) (48). It depletes ATP and induces autophagy and cell death in prostate cancer cells (49). Preferential oxidative cytotoxic effects on cancer cells may be due to the presence of intracellular iron (50), copper (51), an increase in p53 activity (52), and overexpression of sodium-dependent vitamin C transporter 2 (SVCT-2) (53).\nDehydroascorbic acid, the oxidized form of vitamin C, may have cytoprotective effects by preserving mitochondrial membrane potential (38)."}

The two forms utilized in humans are ergocalciferol (D2) and cholecalciferol (D3). Sunlight can promote the synthesis of D3 in the skin. Vitamin D maintains serum calcium and phosphorus levels by regulating their absorption and excretion, and is important for bone formation. Other biologic functions include its role as an antiproliferative agent (1), and as a pro-differentiation hormone (2) with anti-inflammatory and immunoregulatory properties (3). Low levels of vitamin D are associated with a greater risk of mortality (13), may affect cardiovascular health (14), and increase the risk for development of multiple sclerosis in women (74), but a large study found no association between lower levels and cognitive function (15). However, deficiency during pregnancy may affect the neuro-cognitive development of newborns (75). Deficiency can also cause rickets or other bone disorders, and may be a risk factor for extra-skeletal diseases (45). Lower D levels may occur due to time of year or living in northern climates (9); in non-Caucasian race (46) or obese individuals (47); with chronic use of steroids or anticonvulsants; or with diseases such as autoimmune disorders (3), cystic fibrosis (48), kidney disease, and cancer (46) (48) (49).\nClinical data show that vitamin D improves bone mineral density and fracture prevention in the elderly (4) (5) and in postmenopausal women (6), but data are conflicting for primary fracture prevention in men or women following vitamin D and calcium supplementation (7) (8) (9). Recent US Preventive Services Task Force reports found no associations between vitamin D supplementation and reduced falls or fracture incidence for community-dwelling older adults (79) (80). High-dose vitamin D had no benefit on lower extremity function and was associated with an increased risk of falls (64).\nFindings on whether vitamin D protects against cardiovascular (CV) risk factors have varied across populations and regimens. In a Women\u2019s Health Initiative sub-study, calcium plus vitamin D and hormone therapy had a greater effect than either intervention alone or placebo (67); but vitamin D did not improve CV risk factors or physical function in a large long-term trial of older adults (68), and a meta-analysis also found no effect on vascular function markers (81). Yet, in another placebo-controlled trial, vitamin D supplementation benefited diabetic patients with coronary artery disease who were vitamin D-deficient (69). In addition, a single large dose of vitamin D2 improved endothelial function in type-2 diabetic patients (11). In non-dialysis patients with chronic kidney disease, D3 was more effective than D2 in raising serum D levels (70). Dietary vitamin D intake was shown to be inversely associated with mortality from stroke (76).\nIn other trials, vitamin D did not significantly reduce upper respiratory tract infections (URTIs) in healthy adults (16), or infections/antibiotic use in the elderly (17), or prevent viral URTIs in children (71). However, it may protect against influenza (78) and reduce wheezing in some infants (82). Vitamin D was not helpful for mild psoriasis (83) or seasonal affective disorder (18) (19). Supplementation may reduce relapse risk in Crohn\u2019s disease (12), and D3 plus calcium may have a small effect on postmenopausal weight gain (10). A single oral high-dose of D3 significantly improved fatigue in healthy persons who were vitamin D-deficient (72).\nVitamin D has also been examined for prevention of and effects on cancer. In animal models, dietary vitamin D3 demonstrated chemopreventive effects against breast cancer equivalent to those elicited by calcitriol without causing hypercalcemia (20). In humans, vitamin D from sunlight exposure and dietary intake may have protective effects against breast cancer (21) (22), and insufficiency among breast cancer patients is high (23). In postmenopausal women not on estrogen therapy, vitamin D and calcium supplementation may reduce colorectal cancer incidence (24) (25); in women with grade 1 cervical intraepithelial neoplasia, long-term supplementation resulted in regression and improved metabolic status (66). However, in a large trial of healthy postmenopausal women with mean vitamin D levels above those of the US population, taking vitamin D3 plus calcium did not lower cancer risk after 4 years of supplementation (73). In addition, even though pooled analyses found associations between higher serum D levels and lower risks of breast and colon cancers (85) (86), other analyses have not found preventive effects against cancer with high-dose supplementation (87). Other factors contributing to higher D levels and benefit may be at play, such as better diet and lifestyle habits.\nIn patients with advanced hormone-refractory prostate cancer, vitamin D improved pain and muscle strength (26), and slowed the rate of rise of prostate specific antigen (13). In older patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, supplementation normalized vitamin D levels and enhanced efficacy of rituximab (27). Active vitamin D compounds may also decrease incidence of post-transplant malignancy among kidney transplant recipients (28).\nOther data reveal that vitamin D deficiency is highly prevalent in advanced pancreatic cancer (42) and colorectal cancer patients (43), and that CRC patients with higher blood 25(OH)D concentrations have better survival (84). Increased vitamin D intake reduced colorectal cancer risk (29) (31) (32) (33), but had no effect on colorectal adenomas (65). Vitamin D does not have a protective effect against non-Hodgkin lymphoma (34), ovarian (35), kidney (36), endometrial (37), skin (38), or esophageal and gastric (39) cancers, and may significantly increase risk of pancreatic (40) or aggressive prostate cancer (41). In addition, data from meta-analyses are conflicting on whether vitamin D supplementation can reduce cancer incidence or mortality (44) (77).\nThe Institute of Medicine recommends a Daily Dietary Allowance of vitamin D at 600 IU/day with the Upper Level Intake at 4,000 IU/day for bone health (50). Oral supplementation has been shown to be the safest way to increase vitamin D levels (51), although debate continues on how this may translate to optimizing vitamin D status (45). Combined vitamin D and calcium supplementation has been associated with increased kidney stone incidence (7) (80). Therefore, patients should consult with their physicians if a deficiency is suspected to assess the amount of vitamin D needed for health maintenance and to avoid side effects.", "food_sources": "Fatty fish, fish liver oils, egg yolks, fortified milk and cereals (5)", "mechanism_of_action": "The most biologically active metabolite of vitamin D is calcitriol, which regulates calcium and phosphate homeostasis (52). In humans, the primary function of vitamin D is to maintain normal levels of serum calcium and phosphorus concentrations by enhancing small intestine dietary absorption efficiency of these minerals. 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] enhances the efficiency of calcium and phosphorus absorption along the entire small intestine, but primarily in the duodenum and jejunum (5). When dietary calcium intake is insufficient, 25(OH)D and parathyroid hormone (PTH) mobilize monocytic stem cells in the bone marrow to become mature osteoclasts. These osteoclasts mobilize calcium from the bones, thereby maintaining blood calcium levels (50). Vitamin D is thought to have physiological effects in other parts of the body as well because vitamin D receptors (VDRs) are found in the cells of other organs that include intestines, kidney, stomach, brain, prostate, breast, and white blood cells (2) (53).\nThe anticancer effect of vitamin D is thought to be due to induction of cell differentiation (1) (54) and antiproliferation (55). In lymphoma cells, interventional 25(OH)D3 to normalize levels (>30 ng/mL) resulted in significantly stronger antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity, suggesting benefit in D-deficient individuals receiving rituximab (27). In xenograft models of breast cancer, dietary D3 elevated circulating D levels and increased CYP27B1 expression in both tumor and intestines, suggesting it stimulates local calcitriol synthesis in the tumor microenvironment and promotes the ensuing paracrine/autocrine actions that contribute to its anticancer activity (20). The upregulation of CYP27B1 expression by tumors was unique to D3 versus calcitriol in the same tissue (20). In other animal models, a positive feedback signaling loop between the serine-protein kinase ATM (ataxia telangiectasia mutated) and the VDR was identified as critical for cancer chemoprevention by vitamin D (56).\nCalcitriol, the hormonally active form of vitamin D3, targets the vitamin D degrading enzyme CYP24A1, which is most abundant in the kidney, but also expressed in several other tissues (57). CYP24A1 overexpression in colon, ovary, breast, lung, and esophageal malignancies, likely leads to degradation of the locally available D3, impairing its antitumorigenic action in the tumor tissue (57)."}

Natural food sources include plant oils, wheat germ, eggs, green leafy vegetables, and whole grains (3). Vitamin E acts as an antioxidant and is thought to help prevent and treat many diseases. Although available in a variety of formulations, only the d-isomer is considered active (1).\nStudies evaluating vitamin E supplementation suggest that it may improve immune response in the elderly. Vitamin E may slow the progression of Alzheimer\u2019s disease (9) (15) (16) (18); however, conflicting data from another study do not support the utility of antioxidants (vitamin E, vitamin C, lipoid acid, and Coenzyme Q) (43).  It was also ineffective in arresting the development or progression of macular degeneration (14) and Early Parkinson\u2019s Disease (21).\n\nVitamin E did not decrease the incidence of acute respiratory tract infections (12), reduce mortality, or reduce the risk of cardiovascular death or cerebrovascular accident (26). When taken along with vitamin C, vitamin E may increase mortality and nonfatal myocardial infarction in patients with coronary artery disease (13). Further, findings from the recent Physicians\u2019 Health Study II show that neither vitamin E nor C is beneficial in preventing cardiovascular events; vitamin E may actually increase the risk of stroke (36). The Women\u2019s Health Study also failed to find any benefit of vitamin E supplementation in lowering the risk of heart failure in healthy women (42). A meta-analysis showed that vitamin E increases the risk for hemorrhagic stroke but reduces the risk of ischemic stroke (38). Vitamin E can reduce signs and symptoms of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis in adults (45), but not in children and adolescents (46) .\nVitamin E was shown to reduce the risk of some cancers (19) (20). It may help to relieve hot flashes in breast cancer survivors (27), and to reduce the incidence of cisplatin-induced neurotoxicity (22). However, data suggest that supplementation with vitamins C, E, and beta carotene is not beneficial in preventing cancer incidence or affecting cancer mortality (37). Furthermore, vitamin E when used alone or with other supplements did not prevent gastrointestinal cancer (28). A large scale clinical Selenium and Vitamin E Cancer Prevention Trial (SELECT) evaluated the role of vitamin E in prostate cancer prevention. Initial review shows that vitamin E taken alone or with selenium for 5 years did not reduce the risk of prostate cancer (35); observational data from 7 years of participant follow-up indicate a significant increase in the risk of prostate cancer with vitamin E supplementation (41). Vitamin E, when used together with soy and selenium, did not prevent prostate cancer progression (40). Further, findings from other studies indicate vitamin E may actually increase risk of lung cancer (33) and overall mortality (28). At the same time, conflicting data suggest an association between dietary tocopherol and a reduction in risk of lung cancer (38) (48). Also, both dietary and supplemental form of vitamin E may reduce the risk of liver cancer (44).\n\nToxicity may occur with chronic supplementation of vitamin E with doses greater than 800 IU. Daily supplementation over 400 IU may increase all-cause mortality (29). Vitamin E may also enhance the activity of warfarin, but data are inconsistent (7) (8).", "food_sources": "Plant-derived oils (wheat germ, soybean, sunflower, almond, safflower, corn), wheat germ, liver, eggs, nuts and seeds, green leafy vegetables, whole grains (1) (2)", "mechanism_of_action": "Vitamin E is a fat soluble vitamin that acts as an antioxidant. The natural form of vitamin E is composed of 4 different tocopherols and 4 different tocotrienol homologues (alpha, beta, delta and gamma). All 8 forms have antioxidant activity but recent data indicate that the different homologues have different activities unrelated to antioxidant effects (34).\nGamma-tocopherol is a stronger inhibitor of cyclooxygenase and traps reactive oxygen species more effectively than alpha-tocopherol. In vitro and in vivo, gamma-tocopherol exhibits anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic effects where alpha-tocopherol does not (34) . While both alpha- and gamma-tocopherols exhibit anti-inflammatory effects in vitro and in vivo, gamma-enriched mixed tocopherols may be more potent compared to alpha-tocopherols. This may help explain the negative outcomes of recent large-scale intervention studies that used only the alpha homologue (34).\nThe d-alpha-tocopherol isomer is believed to be the active principle. Natural vitamin E supplements contain d-alpha-tocopherol derived from plant oil sources, whereas synthetic supplements are composed of a racemic mixture of d- and l-alpha-tocopherols. The major function of d-alpha-tocopherol is to prevent the propagation of free radical reactions by acting as a peroxyl radical scavenger and protecting polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) within membrane phospholipids and in plasma lipoproteins. Alpha-tocopherol reportedly causes inhibition of protein kinase C activity, which is involved in cell proliferation and differentiation in smooth muscle cells, human platelets, and monocytes. Vitamin E enrichment of endothelial cells, down regulates the expression of intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM-1) and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1), thereby decreasing the adhesion of blood cell components to the endothelium. Vitamin E also upregulates the expression of cytosolic phospholipase A2 and cyclooxegenase-1, which leads to the release of prostacyclin, a potent vasodilator and inhibitor of platelet aggregation in humans (3).\nIn an animal study, vitamin E increased lung cancer cell proliferation due to its antioxidant activity by reducing reactive oxygen species (ROS), DNA damage and p53 expression (47)."}

It also increases tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and cytokine production by activating metabolic pathways involved in tumor cell death (14). In other experiments, WGE demonstrated cytotoxic effects on human lymphoma cells by inducing apoptosis (4) and against ovarian cancer cells via poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP)-1 and PARP-12 expression (5). It was also shown to regulate tumor cell proliferation by inhibiting glycolysis and pentose cycle enzymes (19), and induce apoptosis through caspase-3-mediated PARP cleavage (7).\nRecent studies reported that WGE-treated human cancer cells had significantly lower levels of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEG) and Cox-2 mRNA and protein levels (both markers of angiogenesis) compared to untreated cells (21). WGE also demonstrated cytostatic and growth delay effects associated with impaired glucose utilization resulting in autophagy in human cancer cells (22); and was found effective in inducing mobilization and homing of CD34(+) stem cells to the myocardial tissue, which may help stem cell-based regeneration of infarcted myocardium (23)."}

As an \u03b12-adrenoreceptor antagonist, yohimbine enhances norepinephrine release, increases parasympathomimetic activity, and reduces sympathetic activity (15) (20) (21). Blocking of \u03b12-adrenoreceptors also results in increased blood supply to cavernous body tissue and increased plasma levels of noradrenaline by increasing its release from the sympathetic nervous system (4) (21). In patients with orthostatic hypotension, yohimbine produces a pressor effect by engaging residual sympathetic tone (8)."}

It was formulated a century ago and became a popular remedy for wound healing during the Vietnam War. In the last few decades, the trade name YNBY has been expanded into a product line that includes pills, tincture, and toothpaste. The original formula is believed to contain multiple herbs with notoginseng as the main ingredient. It is also promoted as a dietary supplement that can be used both externally and internally to stop bleeding and to treat cancer in humans and in animals. Other claims include relief from minor aches and pains of muscles and joints associated with backache, arthritis, strains, bruises, sprains, and frostbite (1).\nIn vitro and animal studies indicate that YNBY and notoginseng have hemostatic (2) (3) (4) (5), anti-inflammatory (8) (9) (10) (11) (12) and antimicrobial (5) effects. Notoginseng by itself demonstrated anticoagulant, antiplatelet (6), and fibrinolytic (7) activities.\nClinical studies suggest that YNBY may be effective in treating uterine hemorrhage, ulcerative colitis and skin ulcers (13). It also reduced intraoperative blood loss during transurethral resection of prostate (14) and during oral surgery (15). Case reports indicate that YNBY reduced bleeding in cancer patients (29). But YNBY has not been studied as a cancer treatment.\nGinsenosides derived from notoginseng were shown to exert estrogenic effects (16), and may stimulate the growth of hormone-sensitive breast cancer cells (17) (18).", "food_sources": " ", "mechanism_of_action": "YNBY demonstrates hemostatic effects when applied topically on open wounds (2). Microscopic examination identified nanofiber components in YNBY which may help to activate blood clotting. This carbon-based nanofiber also acts as a scaffolding for tissue repair and prevents infection by sealing up the wound (4).\nAn in vitro study on the wound-healing effects of YNBY suggests anti-inflammatory activity through suppression of lymphocyte growth and expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines (11).  Another study showed modulation of COX and LOX pathways (30). YNBY extract may be useful for rheumatoid arthritis by activating intracellular prostaglandin E(2) and thromboxane B(2) in osteoblasts (8).\nWhen taken internally, YNBY can improve circulation and reduce swelling and bruises. The effects may be due to the anticoagulant and antiplatelet effects (6) exerted systemically by notoginseng via reduction of fibrinogen in blood (7). Notoginseng also was found to protect endothelial function (19) and vascular integrity by regulating Focal Adhesion Kinase (FAK), integrin expression and NF-kappa B functions (20); and to inhibit vascular intimal hyperplasia by lowering the expression of Proliferating Cell Nuclear Antigen (PCNA), cyclinE, cyclinD1, FN and MMP-9. (21).\nYNBY also showed antimicrobial activity. In a Pseudomonas aeruginosa model, a water extract of YNBY reduced bacterial virulence by affecting the quorum-sensing (QS) signaling circuit and by reducing the formation of biofilm (5).\n\nIn other studies, notoginsenoside Ft1, a saponin constituent of notoginseng, induced platelet aggregation by binding to platelet P2Y12 receptors (3). It demonstrated anti-inflammatory effects by inhibiting neutrophil function and NO and PGE2 production, through reduced expression of iNOS and COX-2 (10). A study conducted on peritoneal macrophages found that notoginseng inhibits COX-2 expression at an early stage, elevating it at a later stage (22). Data also suggest it can inhibit expression of NF-kappaB activity and TNF-alpha mRNA (12). Notoginseng may play a role in the treatment of periodontal diseases by suppressing MMP-2 expression and by inhibiting breakdown of bone tissue (9). In another study, Ginsenoside-Rd, isolated from notoginseng, has been shown to reduce atherosclerosis by inhibiting LDL uptake and cholesterol accumulation in macrophages (23).\n\nSome studies report that notoginseng and the constituent ginsenosides mimic estrogen (16) by binding and activating the estrogen receptor (18) and ER-alpha pathway (17). In an animal study, notoginseng selectively sensitized tumor cells to radiation (24). However, this effect has not been demonstrated in humans."}

Benefits of using zeolites in animal feed include increased mineral utilization (1), reduction of heavy metals-induced anemia (2), and reduction of aflatoxin toxicity (3). However, none of these benefits are applicable to humans. In addition, this use has raised concerns about accumulated tissue aluminum in treated livestock (4) vis-a-vis the known link of aluminum to several morbidities including Alzheimer\u2019s disease (5) (6).\nGenerally, the various forms of zeolite are not significantly toxic in acute, short-term oral, or parenteral toxicity studies in animals. However, inhalation toxicity is readily demonstrated (7), and erionite, a type of airborne fibrous zeolite, has been associated with high incidence of malignant mesothelioma (8) (9) (10) (11), and geologic occurrences of erionite are emerging as a concern for respiratory illness in the United States.\nZeolites have limited use in medicine as an external hemostatic dressing for trauma-related injuries (12), potential for controlled drug delivery, as a suspending agent, or for use in cardiopulmonary bypass and hemodialysis procedures (13) (14) (15).\nA small pilot study sponsored by the manufacturer of a proprietary oral zeolite supplement in immunodeficient patients suggests some immunomodulatory effects (16), but no additional studies validate these claims. In an Alzheimer\u2019s mouse model, zeolite reduced oxidative damage and plaque generation (17). Two older animal studies suggest that micronized zeolite may have anticancer benefits (18) (19), but this also has not translated into any further studies.

Zeolite pH buffering effects also adsorb nitrosamines in acidic solution (24), leading to unsubstantiated claims that it could remove carcinogenic substances in the stomach.\nIn vitro studies indicate that micronized zeolite inhibits protein kinase B, induces expression of tumor suppressor proteins (19), and limits reactive oxygen species effects (15).

Zinc supplementation also had a negative treatment effect in severe pediatric bacterial pneumonias, causing significantly longer hospital stays and slower recovery (11).\nIn nursing home elderly, zinc supplementation increased serum zinc concentrations and was associated with enhanced T-cell function (72). However, zinc was not found to be an effective treatment for rheumatoid arthritis, and serum zinc concentrations can actually be higher in patients with RA than healthy individuals (12) (13) (14).\nStudies have found that zinc supplementation can reduce markers of insulin resistance and metabolic syndrome in children (15) (16) and reduce the severity of diarrhea (17) (18) (19).

Zinc influences protein kinase C activity, immunocompetence, apoptosis, and metallothionein levels and has a number of antioxidant and antiinflammatory functions (9) (16) (45) (47) (48) . However, whether zinc elicits antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, or antiapoptotic effects is concentration-dependent and relies on an intricate balance. Under conditions of zinc overload or deficiency, zinc ions become pro-oxidant, proinflammatory, and proapoptotic (46).\nMechanisms that link zinc to tinnitus include cochlear Cu/Zn SOD activity and synaptic transmission (21). Its role in taste perception likely relates to the presence of alkaline phosphatase within the taste-bud membrane (49). Zinc accumulation in bone tissue activates alkaline phosphatase and stimulates collagen synthesis in osteoblasts, which are involved in bone mineralization and calcification (50). Zinc has the ability to complex with viral coat proteins, altering assembly of viral particles (51), and its deficiency increases humoral and cell-mediated immunity dysfunction and susceptibility to infection (47). Supplemental zinc can reduce the ability of the rhinovirus to attach to the human respiratory tract (6). In patients with a common cold, zinc decreases plasma soluble interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (sIL-1fa) and soluble intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (sICAM-1), a cellular receptor for rhinovirus (4). In men with reduced sperm motility, zinc supplementation reduces oxidative stress, apoptosis, and sperm DNA fragmentation (27).\nZinc works with metallothioneins, Cu/Zn SOD, and p53 to combat oxidative stress and mediate DNA damage response and repair (52) (53). In vitro, intracellular zinc accumulation inhibits proliferation of human prostate cancer cells by causing G2/M arrest and upregulating CDKN1A gene expression, which expresses p21 (54) (55). Further, zinc deficiency depresses nuclear p21 and p53 levels (56). Animal models of esophageal cancer demonstrate that zinc-deficiency induces overexpression of proinflammatory mediators S100a8 and S100a9 as well as chemokines, chemokine receptors, cytokines, and Cox-2 (32) (33). Zinc replenishment reduces and also reverses these proinflammatory signatures (33).\nZinc dyshomeostasis has been implicated in breast cancer as a modulator of oxidative stress, DNA damage response/repair pathways, and cell proliferation/apoptosis (52). A diverse group of zinc transporters other than those associated with breast cancer play a role in regulating cell proliferation and apoptosis in prostate, pancreatic and ovarian cancers, suggesting zinc dysregulation in cancer is cell-type specific (52) (53) (54) (57)."}

It is marketed as a dietary supplement for healthy inflammation response and normal cardiovascular and joint function (1).\nPreliminary studies suggest that the ingredients in Zyflamend have anti-inflammatory, antiangiogenic, and antiproliferative properties (2) (12) (13) (14). Zyflamend inhibits the proliferation of oral squamous carcinoma (3), pancreatic cancer (4), and melanoma (5), and cisplatin-resistant bladder cancer cells (15).\nIn an animal model, it inhibited the growth of both hormone-sensitive and hormone-insensitive prostate cancer, and reduced the expression of prostate specific antigen (PSA) (6). It can also suppress elevated levels of proinflammatory mediators and aromatase in obese models (7)and significantly reduced adipose tissue in mice (16).\nIn a phase I trial in men with prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia, Zyflamend did not cause any serious adverse events, and significant reductions in serum levels of C-reactive protein and nuclear factor-kappa B levels were observed (8). There have also been a few cases of clinical response to combination therapy that included a Zyflamend regimen in patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer (17).

It also reduced androgen receptor signaling and enhanced bicalutamide-induced apoptosis (9). Other studies in prostate cancer cell lines suggest that Zyflamend inhibits class I and class II histone deacetylase expression, upregulates p21 expression (13), and regulates upstream kinases LKB1 and CaMKK2 via AMPK activation (14).\nIn melanoma cells, Zyflamend induces autophagy and apoptosis sequentially by activating the intrinsic caspase cascade. Cell migration and COX-2 expression were also suppressed (5). It was also shown to inhibit NF-kappa B activation in myeloid leukemia, lung adenocarcinoma (2), pancreatic (4), and cisplatin-resistant bladder cancer cells (15). In leukoplakia and skin cell lines, both Zyflamend and carnosol, an antioxidant phenolic constituent, inhibited mutagenesis via Hsp90 ATPase inhibition, which led to reduced aryl hydrocarbon receptor levels and CYP1A1 and CYP1B1 suppression (12).\nBoth a cellular model of obesity-related inflammation and an obese animal model indicate that Zyflamend blocks proinflammatory mediators and aromatase induction as well as Akt and NF-kB activation. Increased aromatase mRNA levels and mammary gland activity were also partially inhibited (7). Reduction of adiposity was attributed to AMPK activation (16).\nIn a murine xenograft model of prostate cancer, Zyflamend inhibited androgen-dependent tumor growth and histone deacetylase-5, biomarkers linked to prostate cancer progression (6). It also reduced the number of inflammatory cells, hyperplasia and dysplasia, and tumor incidence and number, and inhibited cell proliferation in an animal model of oral squamous cell carcinoma (3)."}
