A variety of biogenic amines and alkaloids have been isolated from extracts of Acacia rigidula ( 21078 , 89657 ). Some of these amines are believed to have stimulant effects, leading to Acacia rigidula's use in certain weight-loss and athletic performance supplements. Many supplements listing Acacia rigidula as an ingredient have been shown to contain large amounts of phenethylamine. While phenethylamine is a constituent in Acacia rigidula leaves, the amount of phenethylamine found in supplements listing Acacia rigidula as an ingredient is greater than would be expected from plant parts alone ( 21078 ). In addition to phenethylamine, many supplements claiming to contain Acacia rigidula have been found to include another unlisted ingredient, beta-methylphenethylamine (BMPEA) ( 21078 , 29823 ). This ingredient is a stimulant similar to amphetamine. However, unlike phenethylamine, it has not been isolated from Acacia rigidula or any other known plants ( 29823 , 90001 ).

POSSIBLY UNSAFE ...when consumed as a beverage, long term or in high amounts. Black tea contains a significant amount of caffeine. Chronic use, especially in large amounts, can produce tolerance, habituation, psychological dependence, and other significant adverse effects. Doses of caffeine greater than 250-300 mg per day have been associated with significant adverse effects such as tachyarrhythmias and sleep disturbances ( 11832 ). These effects would not be expected to occur with the consumption of decaffeinated black tea. LIKELY UNSAFE ...when consumed as a beverage in very high amounts. The fatal acute oral dose of caffeine is estimated to be 10-14 grams (150-200 mg per kilogram). Serious toxicity can occur at lower doses depending on variables in caffeine sensitivity such as smoking, age, prior caffeine use, etc. ( 11832 ). CHILDREN : POSSIBLY SAFE ...when used in food and beverage amounts ( 4912 , 11833 ). PREGNANCY : POSSIBLY SAFE ...when used orally in moderate amounts. Due to the caffeine content of black tea, mothers should closely monitor their intake to ensure moderate consumption. Caffeine crosses the human placenta, but is not considered a teratogen. Fetal blood concentrations of caffeine approximate maternal concentrations ( 4260 ). The use of caffeine during pregnancy is controversial; however, moderate consumption, less than 200 mg/day, has not been associated with clinically important adverse fetal effects ( 2708 , 2709 , 2710 , 2711 , 9606 , 11733 , 16014 , 16015 , 37802 , 37584 ).

This is similar to the amount of caffeine in about 2 cups of tea. POSSIBLY UNSAFE ...when used orally in large amounts. Caffeine from black tea crosses the placenta, producing fetal blood concentrations similar to maternal levels ( 4260 ). Consumption of caffeine in amounts over 200 mg/day is associated with a significantly increased risk of miscarriage ( 16014 ). Advise mothers to keep caffeine consumption from all sources below 200 mg/day. This is similar to the amount of caffeine in about 2 cups of coffee or tea. High maternal doses of caffeine throughout pregnancy have also resulted in symptoms of caffeine withdrawal in newborn infants ( 9891 ). High doses of caffeine have also been associated with spontaneous abortion, premature delivery, and low birth weight ( 2709 , 2711 , 24995 , 24998 , 37561 , 37898 , 38012 , 38186 , 38199 , 38212 )( 38285 , 38290 ). Some research suggests that fetal birth weight is reduced by 28 grams for every 100 mg/day of caffeine consumed during pregnancy. However, this is unlikely to be clinically significant except for women consuming more than 600 mg of caffeine daily ( 9606 ). Preliminary epidemiological evidence also suggests that maternal consumption of caffeine 400 mg/day or more increases the odds of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) by 65% ( 25001 ). Preliminary evidence from a population study also suggests that increasing maternal consumption of black tea might increase the risk of spina bifida ( 15112 ); however, this finding needs to be verified with additional study. More evidence is needed to determine the safety of using black tea during pregnancy. For now, advise pregnant women to avoid consuming large quantities of black tea. LACTATION : POSSIBLY SAFE ...when used orally in moderate amounts. Due to the caffeine content of black tea, nursing mothers should closely monitor caffeine intake.

DAT0000641|NMCD0000161|DSCUI|background|"The term ""blue-green algae"" refers to several aquatic and photosynthetic bacterial species of the phylum Cyanobacteria. These algae are prokaryotes that lack the nucleus and other intracellular organelles found in true eukaryotic algae ( 91713 ). The most common species of blue-green algae found in supplements are from the Arthrospira genus. These species are collectively referred to as spirulina. Spirulina blue-green algae are harvested from natural lakes, or are grown in commercial ponds where growth of unwanted species is controlled ( 91704 , 91713 ). They grow most prolifically in warm, alkaline water with a high salt content (20-70 grams/L) ( 91713 , 91716 ). Another common species of blue-green algae is Aphanizomenon flos-aquae, which is from the Nostocaceae family. This species of blue-green algae is harvested from large lakes, especially Upper Klamath Lake (Oregon, US). Often samples of this type of blue-green algae are contaminated with other cyanobacteria such as Microcystis aeruginosa, which produce toxic microcystins ( 91704 , 91713 )."|NMCD

Blue-green algae can be contaminated with toxic microcystin-producing cyanobacteria such as Microcystis aeruginosa, and heavy metals (including mercury, cadmium, lead, or arsenic) ( 9171 , 91704 , 91711 ). Microcystins are most commonly reported in the blue-green algae species Aphanizomenon flos-aquae harvested from Upper Klamath Lake in Oregon. When consumed orally, microcystins accumulate in the liver, binding to and inhibiting protein phosphatases, causing hepatocyte damage and possible tumor promotion ( 9171 ). Aphanizomenon flos-aquae can also produce neurotoxic compounds that may be present in supplements containing this organism ( 91704 ). CHILDREN : POSSIBLY UNSAFE ...when blue-green algae products are used orally. Blue-green algae can accumulate heavy metals such as lead and mercury ( 91704 , 91711 ). They can also contain toxic microcystins produced by contaminating species of cyanobacteria such a Microcystis aeruginosa ( 91704 ). Children are more sensitive to poisoning by microcystins ( 3536 ). The Oregon Department of Health has set a limit for microcystins of 1 mcg per gram dry weight of blue-green algae, but some countries have set very low exposure limits of 0.2 mcg per day and 0.8 mcg per day for infants and children, respectively ( 91704 ).

LIKELY UNSAFE ...when used orally in very high doses. The fatal acute oral dose of caffeine is estimated to be 10-14 grams (150-200 mg per kilogram). Serious toxicity can occur at lower doses depending on variables in caffeine sensitivity such as smoking, age, or prior caffeine use ( 11832 , 95700 ). Caffeine products sold to consumers in highly concentrated or pure formulations are considered to a serious health concern because these products have a risk of being used in very high doses. Concentrated liquid caffeine can contain about 2 grams of caffeine in a half cup. Powdered pure caffeine can contain about 3.2 grams of caffeine in one teaspoon. Powdered pure caffeine can be fatal in adults when used in doses of 2 tablespoons or less.

The use of caffeine during pregnancy is controversial; however, moderate consumption, less than 200 mg/day, has not been associated with clinically important adverse fetal effects ( 2708 , 2709 , 2710 , 2711 , 9606 , 16014 , 16015 ). However, consuming amounts over 200 mg/day is associated with a significantly increased risk of miscarriage ( 16014 , 37960 ). Advise mothers to keep caffeine consumption below 200 mg/day. This is similar to the amount of caffeine in about 2 cups of coffee or tea. POSSIBLY UNSAFE ...when used orally in amounts over 200 mg/day.

This is similar to the amount of caffeine in about 2 cups of coffee or tea. Additionally, high maternal doses of caffeine throughout pregnancy have resulted in symptoms of caffeine withdrawal in newborn infants ( 9891 ). High doses of caffeine have also been associated with spontaneous abortion, premature delivery, and low birth weight ( 2709 , 2711 , 91033 , 91048 , 95949 ). Research suggests that fetal birth weight is reduced by 28 grams for every 100 mg/day of caffeine consumed during pregnancy.

Caffeine is the world's most commonly consumed psychoactive chemical. It stimulates the central nervous system (CNS), heart rate, and respiration. It has mood-altering properties and acts as a mild diuretic. Caffeine is one of the most commonly used stimulants among athletes. Caffeine consumption is permitted by the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) within limits. Urine concentrations over 15 mcg/mL are prohibited during competition. It takes 500 mg caffeine, or about 6-8 cups of coffee consumed 2-3 hours before competition to achieve this urine concentration for most people ( 16273 ). Some caffeine products for supplement use are highly concentrated or pure formulations. In 2018, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) announced that such formulations are unlawful when sold directly to consumers in bulk quantities.

However, excessive doses should be avoided. The Institute of Medicine sets the daily tolerable upper intake level (UL) for calcium according to age as follows: Age 0-6 months, 1000 mg; 6-12 months, 1500 mg; 1-8 years, 2500 mg; 9-18 years, 3000 mg; 19-50 years, 2500 mg; 51+ years, 2000 mg ( 17506 ). Doses over these levels can increase the risk of side effects such as kidney stone, hypercalciuria, hypercalcemia and milk-alkali syndrome. There has also been concern that calcium intake may be associated with an increased risk of myocardial infarction. Some initial research suggests that calcium intake, often in amounts over the recommended daily intake level of 1000-1300 mg per day for adults, is associated with an increased risk of myocardial infarction in patients 50-80 years-old ( 16118 , 17482 , 91350 ). However these results, particularly the meta-analyses, have been criticized for excluding some trials in which calcium was administered with vitamin D ( 94137 ). More recent analyses show conflicting results. One analysis published in 2015 shows that calcium 500 mg per day or more, taken alone or along with vitamin D, does NOT increase the risk of myocardial infarction in postmenopausal women ( 93533 ). Another analysis published in 2016 shows that calcium intake, alone or along with vitamin D, is not associated with increased risk of cardiovascular disease in adults when used in amounts that are within tolerable upper intake levels (2000-2500 mg per day) ( 92994 ). Advise patients not to consume more than the recommended daily intake of 1000-1200 mg per day and to consider their total calcium intake from both dietary and supplemental sources ( 17484 ).

The National Academy of Medicine sets the daily tolerable upper intake level (UL) for calcium according to age as follows: Age 0-6 months, 1000 mg; 6-12 months, 1500 mg; 1-3 years, 2500 mg; 9-18 years, 3000 mg; 19-50 years, 2500 mg; 51+ years, 2000 mg ( 17506 ). Doses over these levels can increase the risk of side effects such as kidney stones, hyercalciuria,  hypercalcemia and milk-alkali syndrome. There has also been concern that calcium intake may be associated with an increased risk of myocardial infarction. Some initial research suggests that calcium intake, often in amounts over the recommended daily intake level of 1000-1300 mg per day for adults, is associated with an increased risk of myocardial infarction in patients 50-80 years-old ( 16118 , 17482 , 91350 ). However these results, particularly the meta-analyses, have been criticized for excluding some trials in which calcium was taken with vitamin D ( 94137 ). More recent analyses show conflicting results. One analysis published in 2015 shows that calcium 500 mg per day or more, taken alone or along with vitamin D, does NOT increase the risk of myocardial infarction in postmenopausal women ( 92994 ). Another analysis published in 2016 shows that calcium intake, alone or along with vitamin D, is not associated with increased risk of cardiovascular disease in adults when used in amounts that are within tolerable upper intake levels (2000-2500 mg per day) ( 93533 ). Advise patients to not consume more than the recommended daily intake 1000 mg to 1200 mg per day and to consider their total calcium intake from both dietary and supplemental sources ( 17484 ). To figure out dietary calcium, count 300 mg/day from non-dairy foods plus 300 mg/cup of milk or fortified orange juice.

DAT0001173|NMCD0000294|DSCUI|background|Ciguatoxins are a family of toxins that cause a type of food poisoning called ciguatera. Ciguatera is the most common type of non-bacterial seafood poisoning. Ciguatera can be caused by eating reef fish contaminated with ciguatoxins ( 95315 , 95316 ). The fish become contaminated with ciguatoxins after consuming the pretoxin directly from marine dinoflagellates such as Gambierdiscus toxicus, or by bio-accumulation via the marine food chain. Contaminated fish appear normal but can cause gastrointestinal, neurological, and cardiovascular symptoms when consumed by humans ( 42995 , 43078 , 43135 , 43171 ). Over 400 normally safe fish species, including the red snapper, barracuda, parrotfish, jacks, surgeon, grouper, humphead wrasse, and moray eel, can become contaminated with ciguatoxins. These fish are more likely to be contaminated if they are fished from areas of recently disturbed coral reefs, such as areas with waterfront construction or following cyclones ( 6 , 43031 , 95315 , 95316 , 95319 ).|NMCD

In humans, very high doses of coumarin, about 50-7000 mg daily, can result in hepatotoxicity that resolves when coumarin use is discontinued ( 15302 ). In most cases, ingestion of Cinnamomum burmannii will not provide a high enough amount of coumarin to cause significant toxicity; however, in especially sensitive people, such as those with liver disease, prolonged ingestion of large amounts of Cinnamomum burmanniii might exacerbate the condition.

Traditionally, the Dendrobium nobile species has been used in Traditional Chinese medicine. Today, dendrobium is showing up in pre-workout supplements used to boost physical and athletic performance. Some experts are claiming that dendrobium will be the next hot stimulant supplement. Some are touting it as a replacement for the stimulant dimethylamylamine (DMAA) . As of March 16, 2012, the manufacturer of a popular dendrobium-containing supplement ( Craze , Driven Sports) was the subject of a class action lawsuit. The lawsuit alleges that the product contains amphetamines, that the product is manufactured in a non-compliant facility, and that the ingredient, dendrobium, is a new dietary ingredient (NDI), which requires an NDI notification to FDA ( 17965 ). While Dendrobium nobile and Dendrobium officinale have been used historically in traditional medicine, there is concern that this and other dendrobium-containing products may be spiked with synthetic stimulants. For example, the dendrobium-containing commercial product Craze by Driven Sports contains phenylethylamine which some experts say does not occur naturally in any significant amount in dendrobium plants ( 17966 ).

Although higher doses of fish oil, such as 6 grams daily for up to 1 year, have been used safely ( 89344 ), there are some safety concerns about using high doses of fish oil. Some older research suggests that doses greater than 3 grams per day can inhibit blood coagulation and potentially increase bleeding risk ( 8671 , 8679 , 8696 , 66258 , 21223 , 21224 ). However, the most rigorous research to date shows that short-term doses of fish oil 10 grams daily and long-term doses of 1.5 grams daily for up to 52 weeks do not increase the risk of bleeding or affect coagulation parameters in chronically ill and vulnerable patients ( 97180 ). Still, doses greater than 3 grams per day might suppress immune response ( 1313 , 7384 ). Patients should only take high-dose fish oil while under medical supervision.

Doses above 1 mg per day should also be avoided if possible to prevent precipitation or exacerbation of neuropathy related to vitamin B12 deficiency ( 6241 , 6242 , 6245 ). However, there is contradictory evidence suggesting that higher doses may not be harmful. There is some evidence that doses of 5 mg per day orally for up to 4 months can be used safely if vitamin B12 levels are routinely measured ( 7725 ). Also, other clinical research suggests that folic acid supplementation at doses up to 5 mg, usually in combination with vitamin B12, does not increase the risk of cancer when taken for 2-7 years ( 91312 ). Very high doses of 15 mg per day can cause significant central nervous system (CNS) and gastrointestinal side effects ( 505 ).

Also, a gel containing ginger and plai at a total of 4% by weight (Plygersic gel) has been safely used for up to 6 weeks ( 89897 ). CHILDREN : POSSIBLY SAFE ...when used orally and appropriately, short-term. Ginger powder has been used with apparent safety in clinical research at a dose of up to 750 mg daily for 4 days in girls aged 14-18 years ( 96255 ). PREGNANCY : POSSIBLY SAFE ...when used orally for medicinal purposes. Using ginger during pregnancy is controversial ( 1921 , 7083 , 96254 ). There is some concern due to preliminary evidence that ginger might affect fetal sex hormones ( 7083 ), and an anecdotal report of spontaneous abortion during week 12 of pregnancy in a patient who used ginger for morning sickness ( 721 ). One observational study also found that women who took dried ginger during the first 20 weeks of pregnancy had a marginally increased chance of stillbirth compared to those who did not take ginger. However, of the women who reported taking ginger in this study also reported taking multiple other herbal supplements, so it is not clear if ginger is a causal agent ( 96254 ). Other studies in pregnant women suggest that ginger can be used safely for morning sickness without harm to the fetus. The risk for major malformations in infants of women taking ginger does not appear to be higher than the baseline rate of 1% to 3% ( 721 , 1922 , 5343 , 11346 , 13071 , 13080 , 96254 ). Also, controlled research suggests that ginger intake does not significantly affect the risk of spontaneous abortion ( 90103 ). Population research from 1020 women who used ginger during pregnancy, including 466 in the first trimester, did not show any increased risk of congenital malformations, stillbirth, perinatal death, preterm birth, low birth weight, or low Apgar scores associated with ginger use ( 18211 ). Ginger use has been associated with an increase in vaginal bleeding, including spotting, after week 17 of pregnancy, but the association was not significant for severe bleeding episodes ( 18211 ). Because ginger can inhibit thromboxane synthesis and platelet aggregation in vitro, there is concern that use close to labor might increase the risk of postpartum hemorrhage ( 18211 ). As with any medication taken during pregnancy, the potential benefit to risk must be weighed. LACTATION : Insufficient reliable information available; avoid using.|NMCD

POSSIBLY UNSAFE ...when used orally long-term and in high doses. Green tea contains a significant amount of caffeine. Chronic use, especially in large amounts, can produce tolerance, habituation, psychological dependence, and other significant adverse effects. Doses of caffeine greater than 250-300 mg per day have been associated with significant adverse effects such as tachyarrhythmias and sleep disturbances ( 11832 ). These effects would not be expected to occur with the consumption of decaffeinated green tea. There is also some speculation that green tea products containing higher amounts of the catechin epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) might have increased risk of adverse events. Some research has found that taking green tea products containing EGCG levels greater than 200 mg is associated with increased risk of mild adverse effects such as constipation, increased blood pressure, and rash ( 90161 ). Other research has found that doses of EGCG equal to or above 800 mg daily may be associated with increased risk of liver injury in humans ( 95440 , 95696 ). LIKELY UNSAFE ...when used orally in very high doses. The fatal acute oral dose of caffeine in green tea is estimated to be 10-14 grams (150-200 mg per kilogram). Serious toxicity can occur at lower doses depending on variables in caffeine sensitivity such as smoking, age, and prior caffeine use ( 11832 ). CHILDREN : POSSIBLY SAFE ...when used in amounts commonly found in foods and beverages ( 4912 , 11833 ). ...when used for gargling three times daily for up to 90 days ( 90150 ). There is insufficient reliable information available about the safety of green tea extract when used orally in children. However, taking green tea extract orally has been associated with potentially serious albeit uncommon and unpredictable cases of hepatotoxicity in adults. Therefore, some experts recommend that children under the age of 18 years of age do not use products containing green tea extract ( 94897 ). PREGNANCY : POSSIBLY SAFE ...when used orally in moderate amounts. Due to the caffeine content of green tea, mothers should closely monitor their intake to ensure moderate consumption. Caffeine crosses the human placenta, but is not considered a teratogen. Fetal blood concentrations of caffeine approximate maternal concentrations ( 4260 ). The use of caffeine during pregnancy is controversial; however, moderate consumption, less than 200 mg/day, has not been associated with clinically important adverse fetal effects ( 2708 , 2709 , 2710 , 2711 , 9606 , 11733 , 16014 , 16015 ). However, consuming amounts over 200 mg/day is associated with a significantly increased risk of miscarriage ( 16014 ). Advise mothers to keep caffeine consumption below 200 mg/day. This is similar to the amount of caffeine in about 2 cups of tea. Based on animal models, green tea extract catechins are also transferred to the fetus, but in amounts 50-100 times less than maternal concentrations ( 15010 ). The potential impact of these catechins on the human fetus is not known, but animal models suggest that the catechins are not teratogenic ( 15011 ). POSSIBLY UNSAFE ...when used orally in large amounts. Caffeine from green tea crosses the placenta, producing fetal blood concentrations similar to maternal levels ( 4260 ). Consumption of caffeine in amounts over 200 mg/day is associated with a significantly increased risk of miscarriage ( 16014 ). Advise mothers to keep caffeine consumption from all sources below 200 mg/day. This is similar to the amount of caffeine in about 2 cups of coffee or tea. High maternal doses of caffeine throughout pregnancy have also resulted in symptoms of caffeine withdrawal in newborn infants ( 9891 ). High doses of caffeine have also been associated with spontaneous abortion, premature delivery, and low birth weight ( 2709 , 2711 ). Some research suggests that fetal birth weight is reduced by 28 grams for every 100 mg/day of caffeine consumed during pregnancy. However, this is unlikely to be clinically significant except for women consuming more than 600 mg of caffeine daily ( 9606 ). There is also concern that consuming large amounts of green tea consumption might have antifolate activity and potentially increase the risk of folic acid deficiency-related birth defects. Catechins in green tea inhibit the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase in vitro ( 15012 ). This enzyme is responsible for converting folic acid to its active form. Preliminary evidence suggests that increasing maternal tea consumption is associated with increased risk of spina bifida ( 15068 ). Also, evidence from epidemiological research suggests that serum folate levels in pregnant women with high green tea intake (57.3 mL per 1000 kcal) are decreased compared to participants who consume moderate or low amounts of green tea ( 90171 ). More evidence is needed to determine the safety of using green tea during pregnancy. For now, advise pregnant women to avoid consuming large quantities of green tea. LACTATION : POSSIBLY SAFE ...when used orally in moderate amounts. Due to the caffeine content of green tea, nursing mothers should closely monitor caffeine intake. Breast milk concentrations of caffeine are thought to be approximately 50% of maternal serum concentrations. Minimal consumption would likely result in limited exposure to a nursing infant ( 9892 ).

The main function of L-carnitine is to transfer long-chain fatty acids in the form of their acyl-carnitine esters across the inner mitochondrial membrane before beta-oxidation ( 90632 , 95068 ). This process allows the body to turn fat into energy ( 90919 ). Most of L-carnitine is provided by the diet, especially from dairy products and red meat. It is also found in certain fish and plants. In the liver and kidneys, L-carnitine can also be synthesized from the amino acids methionine and/or lysine ( 95068 , 95070 , 95073 ). Almost all of the total body L-carnitine is confined to the skeletal and cardiac muscle at concentrations approximately 70 times higher than in the blood serum ( 12352 , 95070 ). Its concentration in the plasma varies with age. The concentration tends to increase until roughly 70 years of age, and then declines with reduction in body and muscle mass ( 95070 ).

POSSIBLY UNSAFE ...when used orally in large amounts for several weeks or smaller amounts for longer periods of time. Consuming licorice daily for several weeks or longer can cause severe adverse events including hypertension, hypokalemia, rhabdomyolysis, thrombocytopenia, alkalosis, weakness, paralysis, ventricular fibrillation, cardiac arrest, Brugada syndrome, paralysis, ventricular tachycardia, and occasionally encephalopathy, in otherwise healthy people. Although 20 grams or more licorice daily are more likely to cause these effects, smaller amounts have also caused hypokalemia and associated symptoms when taken for periods of time lasting for months to years ( 781 , 15590 , 15592 , 15594 , 15596 , 15597 , 15599 , 15600 , 16058 , 59731 )( 59740 , 59752 , 59785 , 59786 , 59787 , 59792 , 59795 , 59805 , 59816 , 59818 )( 59820 , 59822 , 59826 , 59828 , 59849 , 59851 , 59867 , 59882 , 59885 , 59888 )( 59889 , 59895 , 59900 , 59906 ).

Consumption of licorice at higher levels, such as 750 grams per day in one report, and lower levels, such as 100 mg per day in others, has resulted in pseudohyperaldosteronism/mineralocorticoid excess ( 781 , 3252 , 31563 , 59771 , 59811 , 59850 ). PREGNANCY : UNSAFE ...when used orally. Licorice has abortifacient, estrogenic, and steroid effects. It can also cause uterine stimulation. Heavy consumption of licorice, equivalent to 500 mg of glycyrrhizic acid per week (about 250 grams of licorice per week), during pregnancy seems to increase the risk of delivering before gestational age of 38 weeks ( 7619 , 10618 ). Furthermore, high intake of glycyrrhizin, at least 500 mg per week, during pregnant is associated with increased salivary cortisol levels in children of the mothers by the age of 8 years.

This rule is based on the FDA's conclusion that plant sterol esters in conjunction with a diet low in saturated fat and cholesterol might reduce the risk of CHD by lowering blood cholesterol levels ( 6668 ). However, although there is plenty of evidence that plant sterols and stanols lower cholesterol levels, so far there is no proof that long-term use actually lowers the risk of developing CHD.|NMCD

It can be identified by the arrangement of the leaves alternately on the stem, with each leaf always having three leaflets. In spring, the new leaves are reddish in color, gradually turning green. In the summer, small white flowers bloom and turn into clusters of pea-sized, greenish-yellow berries. In the fall, the leaves turn to red and orange and are then shed, leaving just the berries on the stem. All parts of the plant contain urushiol, which is oily and helps the plant retain water.

Caffeine crosses the placenta, producing fetal blood concentrations similar to maternal levels ( 4260 ). Mothers should avoid consuming more than 300 mg of caffeine daily or more than 3 cups of tea or coffee per day ( 2708 ). High maternal doses of caffeine throughout pregnancy have resulted in symptoms of caffeine withdrawal in newborn infants ( 9891 ). High doses of caffeine have been associated with spontaneous abortion, premature delivery, and low birth weight ( 2709 , 2711 ). Fetal birth weight is reduced by 28 grams for every 100 mg per day of caffeine consumed during pregnancy.

Soy extracts containing concentrated isoflavones in doses of 35-120 mg/day seem to be safe when used for up to 6 months ( 4751 , 6455 , 7802 , 12040 , 12048 , 13209 , 95994 , 95999 ). POSSIBLY UNSAFE ...when soy extracts are used orally in high doses, long-term. Postmenopausal women who consume soy isoflavone tablets 150 mg/day for 5 years seem to have an increased occurrence of simple hyperplasia of the endometrium ( 12105 ). However, there is no evidence that this dose of soy isoflavones increases the risk of atypical hyperplasia, which has a much higher risk of developing into endometrial cancer ( 12105 , 90973 ). There is no evidence that consuming a diet that is high in soy foods causes this potential adverse effect. In fact, people who consume a diet high in soy foods actually seem to have a reduced risk of endometrial cancer ( 7338 , 10372 , 96002 ). CHILDREN : LIKELY SAFE ...when consumed in amounts commonly found in foods ( 4912 ). Soy in amounts commonly found in food or as a component of infant formula seem to be safe ( 3400 , 7331 ).

These different forms of vitamin A are often collectively referred to as ""retinoids."" The most potent form of vitamin A, all-trans retinol, is the form of retinol in the diet ( 9191 ). Retinol is present in esterified form in animal-derived products including eggs, whole milk, butter, fortified margarine, meat, and oily saltwater fish ( 7135 ). Animal liver contains the highest amount of dietary retinol. About two-thirds of vitamin A intake comes from dietary retinol ( 9189 ). The vitamin A family also includes provitamin A carotenoids, which are dietary precursors to retinol. About a third of dietary vitamin A comes from plants, which synthesize carotenoids that are converted to vitamin A in the body ( 7135 ). Carotenoid pigments (including alpha-, beta-, and gamma-carotene and cryptoxanthin) are present in grains, oils, green and yellow vegetables, and especially in carrots and fruits ( 8044 ).

DHEA and its sulfated form, DHEA-S, are the most abundant steroid hormones in the human body. DHEA serves as a precursor to male and female sex hormones (androgens and estrogens). DHEA levels in the body begin to decrease after age 30. This decrease occurs more rapidly in women than men. Low DHEA levels are implicated in numerous pathologies, including adrenal insufficiency, AIDS, Alzheimer's disease, cardiovascular disease, depression, diabetes, inflammation, immune disorders, and osteoporosis. DHEA levels may also be depleted by a number of drugs, including corticosteroids, oral contraceptives, and antipsychotic agents ( 47429 , 90314 ).

DAT0004767|NMCD0001192|DSCUI|background|Silicon is a nonmetallic element with an atomic weight of 28. It is ubiquitous in the environment and in the earth. Silicon represents 28% of the earth's crust and mantle, also known as the lithosphere, where it is the second-most abundant element, after oxygen. Silicon binds to oxygen with high affinity and may occur as crystalline or amorphous silica (silicon dioxide, SiO 2 ) or as silicates, such as quartz, which consist of silicon and oxygen bound to other elements. Silicates represent 92% of all minerals ( 75089 ). Chemical and biological weathering solubilizes silicon and makes it available as silicic acid, Si(OH) 4 ( 75101 ). Silicon is a trace mineral that is found in the body as orthosilicic acid. Silicon dioxide, also known as silica, is present in foods such as vegetables, whole gains, and seafood ( 11556 , 92135 ). Coffee, beer, and unfiltered drinking water or water from artesian aquifers are the major sources of dietary silicon, followed by grains, grain products, fruits and vegetables, especially bananas, raisins, beans, and lentils. The average intake of silicon in adults is 14 to 21 mg per day. Foods from animal sources and silicate food additives (which prevent foaming and caking) are lesser sources. The bioavailability of silicate additives is low. A clear biological function of silicon in humans has not been established.  ( 7135 , 12425 , 92135 , 95009 ). DO NOT CONFUSE silicon with silicone.

DAT0004775|NMCD0001194|DSCUI|background|Sitostanol is a saturated form of the plant sterol, sitosterol. Structurally, sitostanol resembles cholesterol. It is derived from vegetable oils or the oil from pine tree wood pulp. When used in commercial products, sitostanol is made fat-soluble by converting to a sitostanol ester using canola oil ( 5435 , 5430 , 5814 ). Sitostanol is an ingredient in the functional food product Benecol margarine and in some salad dressings. The FDA has authorized the use of labeling health claims for foods containing sitostanol-esters and other plant stanol esters for reducing the risk of coronary heart disease (CHD). This rule is based on the FDA's conclusion that plant stanol esters in conjunction with a diet low in saturated fat and cholesterol might reduce the risk of CHD by lowering blood cholesterol levels ( 6668 ). However, while there is plenty of evidence that sitostanol lowers cholesterol levels, so far there is no proof that long-term use actually lowers the risk of developing CHD.|NMCD
